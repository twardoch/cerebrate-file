# CHAPTER TWO

## ‘Speckled Bodies’: Russian Voyagers and Nuku Hivans, 1804

Elena Govor

In 1804, during the return voyage of the first Russian circumnavigation, the ships _Nadezhda_ and _Neva_ anchored for several weeks in the Bay of Taiohae on Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands. The expedition's artists produced numerous drawings of tattooed Marquesans, including several full-body portraits that became famous in the history of Pacific art. These images, more than any others, came to epitomize the visual impact of traditional Marquesan tattooing, or _te patu tiki_ , in European eyes.

The Russian expedition was led by Adam Johann von Krusenstern (Ivan Kruzenshtern) and included a large scientific staff with several artists. The most prolific was the young midshipman and talented draftsman Yuri Lisyansky (Iury Lisiansky), who later published an account of the voyage. The expedition's naturalist, Adelbert von Chamisso, who subsequently became a renowned poet and botanist, also wrote detailed observations of Marquesan culture, including tattooing practices.

During their stay, the Russians encountered a chiefly family who were particularly cooperative and who provided them with extensive cultural information. The artists produced multiple portraits of these individuals, showing the full extent of their body markings. Unlike earlier European visitors who had only fleeting glimpses of tattooed Pacific Islanders, the Russian expedition had the time and the willing subjects to document the practice comprehensively.

Chamisso's account described the tattooing process in detail:

The operation is performed with small bone or shell instruments, similar to combs, which are struck with a mallet to puncture the skin. The pigment used is a black substance made from burnt candlenut, which is rubbed into the wounds. The process is extremely painful and can take many hours or even days to complete. The tattooing covers the entire body of mature men, creating intricate patterns of lines, spirals, and geometric designs.

The Russian artists produced drawings that showed both the faces and the full bodies of their subjects, revealing the comprehensive nature of Marquesan tattooing. These included portraits of individuals identified as members of the royal family of Taiohae, whose names and genealogies were recorded by the expedition.

The images produced by the Russian expedition became widely reproduced in subsequent publications and played a crucial role in shaping European perceptions of Pacific tattooing. They showed tattooing not merely as decoration but as a comprehensive cultural practice that covered the entire body and had deep social significance.

The encounter also involved extensive tattooing of Russian crew members by local practitioners. Several sailors and officers received tattoos during their stay, continuing the tradition begun by Cook's voyagers decades earlier. These tattoos were not merely souvenirs but were part of a broader cultural exchange that characterized the Russian expedition's approach to Pacific peoples.

The Russian circumnavigation thus represents a pivotal moment in the history of cross-cultural tattooing encounters. The extensive documentation produced by the expedition's artists and naturalists, combined with the mutual tattooing that took place, created a more complete picture of Marquesan tattooing than had been available to earlier European visitors. This encounter also demonstrated the continuing appeal of Pacific tattooing practices to European mariners and the complex dynamics of cultural exchange that characterized such meetings.# CHAPTER TWO

## ‘Speckled Bodies’: Russian Voyagers and Nuku Hivans, 1804

Elena Govor

He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow  
Ecclesiastes 1:18

The world of _te patu tiki_ – Marquesan tattoo – has attracted scholars for more than two centuries. After the detailed examination and inventory published by Karl Steinen in the 1920s, the modern ethnological study by Alfred Gell and the most complete recent work by Pierre and Marie-Noëlle Ottino-Garanger,[1](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-1) it might be thought that this theme had been explored in full. Nevertheless, my attempt to look more closely at the inception of the rich body of information on tattoo in a particular part of the Marquesas – the island of Nuku Hiva – brought to light unexpected discoveries that in some respects go beyond this limited area and raise a number of more general questions.

The object of my study is the first Russian round-the-world expedition on the sloops _Nadezhda_ and _Neva_, which spent twelve days at Taiohae Bay at Nuku Hiva in May 1804. The accounts by its principal members – the commander and captain of the _Nadezhda_, Adam Krusenstern (Ivan Kruzenshtern in Russian), the captain of the _Neva_, Iury Lisiansky, and the naturalist Georg Langsdorff – translated into Western languages and the visual imagery published in their works belong to the corpus of so-called classical sources about Nuku Hiva.[2](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-2) But numerous materials were not translated: being scattered in Russian periodicals and locked in Soviet archives, they remained almost inaccessible to Western scholars. During a recent research trip to Russia, I was able to copy little-known accounts by Langsdorff, the artist-naturalist Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau (including his original sketchbook), Makar Ratmanov, Fedor Romberg, Fedor Shemelin, Nikolai Rezanov, Nikolai Korobitsyn, Archpriest Gedeon and Vasily Berkh, as well as a Russian translation of the diary of four Japanese men who had been shipwrecked in Russian waters in 1790 and who were being returned to Japan on board the _Nadezhda_. The German manuscript of the voluminous journal of Lieutenant Herman Loewenstern (Ermolai Levenshtern in Russian) has recently been published in Russian translation, while many of his drawings are held by the Estonian Historical Archives.[3](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-3) Langsdorff's original drawings are extant, while Tilesius and Langsdorff also published accounts of the voyage in early nineteenth-century German periodicals. The written and pictorial accounts of over a dozen members of the expedition have been brought together here for the first time, including works by at least three artists – Tilesius, Langsdorff and Loewenstern.

None of the other early voyages to the Pacific, including Cook's, produced such numerous and diverse accounts. My research so far has not only brought to light new material but permits the juxtaposition of different genres, each of which enhances the others. My textual analysis of the English versions of the classical accounts by Krusenstern, Langsdorff and Lisiansky in tandem with their Russian/German originals helped eliminate numerous misreadings in translations. The process raises the general problem of the contingency of the early texts that are used for ethno-historical reconstructions, but this chapter deals mainly with pictorial representations, including the portraits of several well-known personalities, most of whom are depicted with more or less elaborate tattoo.

Tilesius made the important remark that he 'had drawn portraits of . . . the members of the king's family'.[4](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-4) Indeed, the selection of people whom the Russians drew and the way they were represented did not occur by chance. Plate xv in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ entitled 'Depiction of the faces of Nuka Hivans' is an engraved collective portrait of 'King Ketenue's court', where each person occupies a corresponding position (illus. 30). This 'court' at the time of the Russian visit was not numerous. It included about a dozen close family members to whom the visitors constantly referred and who became the models for their drawings. In total, the three Russian artists produced detailed drawings of more than 20 individuals, whom I try here to identify with particular named persons.

The central figure in the Russians' interactions with the Nuku Hivans was 'king' Keatonui, called 'Ketenue' by the Russians. He was described by many voyagers, including the London Missionary Society missionary William Pascoe Crook, the beachcomber Edward Robarts, and the US Navy captain David Porter, but no particular visual imagery has previously been associated with him. Russian visitors broke the ground in this respect. Tilesius' drawing of the 'king' in his sketchbook,[5](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-5) inscribed 'Kettenue', uses classical conventions to an anthropological end – to represent a typical member of a particular ethnic group rather than an individual personality (illus. 31). The drawing was engraved in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ as the central figure in the upper row of plate xv (illus. 30). The engraver, I. S. Klauber, added tattoo designs to the shoulder that were lacking in Tilesius' drawing but which presumably were meant to contribute to the solemnity of the 'king'. The most interesting representation of Keatonui is the full-length portrait drawn by Loewenstern (illus. 32). Not an artist by profession, he nevertheless managed to catch the individuality of this important man. The solemn, imposing, slightly corpulent, probably late middle-aged man depicted in the act of presenting a kava plant (_piper methysticum_) is certainly more than a curiously decorated savage. Although naked, he seems to be richly dressed – in tattoos. The picture refers to the particular moment when Keatonui visited the _Nadezhda_ for the first time. Lieutenant Romberg briefly remarked in a letter to his friends: 'The naked king with a sapling in his hand made a visit to us'.[6](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-6) Tilesius provided further details:

a big pirogue pulled up to our ship. There was an exceptionally corpulent and completely tattooed man with a thick neck standing at the front. His body was of dark-blue colour. This fat man was called the king of the valley . . . His name is Kettenue, Tapega. The latter is his title which means right hand. In the right hand he was carrying a pepper plant, from which an intoxicating drink is made, signifying by this peace and friendship.[7](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-7)

Shemelin, the supercargo on the voyage, wrote about Keatonui with respect, sympathy and some humour. Shemelin was not shocked by the naked tattooed body of 'the king', but the density of his tattoos so darkened his skin as to remind Shemelin of an African – a common analogy in the early literature on Polynesian tattoo (see Douglas, this volume):

The king seemed to be over fifty already, he was stately and of a large stature. Unlike his retinue, bold and talkative, he was distinguished by modesty and reticence which imparted him a spirit of some dignity . . .

His questions about the things around him were brief, his answers even briefer. . . . The things which he saw probably for the first time in his life had little effect on his curiosity. He preferred to all practical things he saw a big mirror in the Captain's cabin, to which he came up with a joyful air and looked at himself in it from top to bottom, outstretching hands, bending to all sides, turning to it with his sides and back and seemed to admire with delight his patterned skin which was all speckled with circles, ovals, wide and narrow strips and lattices so thickly that there was not even a nail sized spot clear of black dots left on his body, so that the King under his foppish dress seemed to be a true native of Angola.[8](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-8)

Loewenstern, who referred to Keatonui's tattooed skin as 'dark-blue, nearly black',[9](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-9) managed to convey this impression in his drawing, in which, however, the details of the tattoos on the face are indistinguishable and schematic. Tilesius, on the contrary, attempted to trace the pattern of the tattoo in his drawing of Keatonui's head.

There is tantalizing information about one more portrait of Keatonui done by the artist of the expedition Stepan Kurliandtsev, a Russian portraitist. It surfaced in the documents of the Academy of Fine Arts in St Petersburg at least twice. In 1818 Kurliandtsev applied for financial assistance, referring to his work on the portrait of 'Katenue, king of Taiogai'. In the following year he submitted the painting as a gift to the tsar, Alexander I. The officials considered that it was 'rather weak' and returned it to Kurliandtsev. Its further destiny, as well as that of his entire pictorial legacy, remains unknown.[10](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-10)

Tilesius made at least two portraits of Keatonui's 'brothers'. One drawing in his sketchbook is entitled 'Pienui der Bruder des Königes Kettenue' (illus. 33) and another simply 'Tamatoi' (illus. 31).[11](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-11) The engraver reworked head and neck drawings by Tilesius into upper bust engravings and added chest shields. Aligned alongside Keatonui in plate xv of Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ (illus. 30), they resemble him somewhat in tattoo style and facial traits. 'Tama toi' was most likely Keatonui's youngest brother recorded by the missionary Crook as 'Tamati'. Loewenstern recorded in his journal that 'Tama tai, his [the "king's"] brother, has the name of an enemy he killed'.[12](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-12) As for 'Pienui', it is hard to say with certainty which of Keatonui's nine brothers he might have been, but it is likely that the 'king's brother' mentioned by nearly all the Russian voyagers was he. Analysis of the Russian accounts suggests also that he ranked next to Keatonui in importance. 'The king's brother' (never 'a brother') was the first visitor to the _Nadezhda_ when it had just moored. He visited the ship soon afterwards in Keatonui's retinue but only he and Keatonui himself were singled out to be entertained with tea in the captain's cabin. Rezanov, the envoy extraordinary aboard the _Nadezhda_, commented that they were tattooed more than the others and, according to Rezanov and Shemelin, the gifts the brother received were nearly equal to those given to the 'king'.[13](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-13) 'The king's brother' accompanied Keatonui during their visit to the _Neva_, where he bartered a pig and a piglet for a duck and a drake. The priest Gedeon explained that they hoped that the duck would have offspring with red feathers.[14](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-14) Red feathers were prestigious items in the Marquesas, and probably the brothers made the association with the Brazilian red parrots that had fascinated them on the _Nadezhda_. Lisiansky remarked that on the way to Keatonui's residence they had a break to rest at his brother's house. Finally, he mentioned that 'the brother of the king of Tayohaia married the daughter' of the neighbouring chief to the west and that this union had stopped warfare between the two districts.[15](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-15)

The upper row of plate xv in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ depicts a profile portrait of a man who seemingly broke the mould of Keatonui's relatives by virtue of his curly hair without 'horns' (illus. 30). The inscription over this portrait in Tilesius's sketchbook reads 'Taputakaya Mufäu' (illus. 34). Langsdorff referred to him as 'Mau-ka-u, or Mufau Taputa kava', others as 'Muhau', 'Maugau', 'Mugau'. All the participants in the expedition admired 'his extraordinary height, the vast strength of his body, and the admirable proportion of his limbs and muscles'. Tilesius measured every part of his body and sent the details to the great German comparative anatomist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in Göttingen. Blumenbach 'compared these proportions with the Apollo of Belvedere, and found that those of that masterpiece of the finest ages of Grecian art, in which is combined every possible integer in the composition of manly beauty, corresponded exactly with our Mufau, an inhabitant of the island of Nukahiwa'.[16](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-16) Independently of the savants, who were mostly Germanic in origin, Shemelin, an ethnic Russian who went on an excursion around the island with 'Mugau', wrote: 'His limbs were so well proportioned that sculpture and art depicting human perfection would never find a better example than this Nuahivan Hercules'.[17](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-17)

Unsurprisingly, the voyagers' pictorial representations of 'Mufau' were not limited to Tilesius' drawing. I believe that the famous coloured engraving of the 'Man from Nuku Hiva Island' depicted with a club, _u'u_, on his right shoulder and a gourd in his left hand in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ is also a portrait of Mufau (illus. 35). Krusenshtern wrote in the Russian edition of his _Voyage_ that Mufau was the 'handsomest men that ever existed' and that 'The attached drawing would represent more clearly his gigantic, perfectly built body'.[18](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-18) Versions of this engraving illustrate both the German and English editions of Krusenshtern's _Voyage_, while it is the only full-length detailed portrait of a Nuku Hivan in the Russian _Atlas_. There is no original full-length drawing of Mufau in Tilesius' sketchbook, although there is a sketch of a man's head wearing a headdress made from pig's teeth similar to that in the engraving of Mufau. This face is depicted with no tattoo at all, probably because the artist was in this instance more concerned to show the man's ornamentation and facial expression.[19](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-19) A coloured drawing presumably of Mufau by Tilesius was preserved among Blumenbach's papers in Göttingen (illus. 36).[20](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-20) Here Mufau holds the same club in his right hand while his outstretched left hand grasps the outline of a vertical spear. It is probable that Tilesius sent this drawing to Blumenbach in connection with his account of Mufau's figure. The meticulously prepared coloured engraving of Mufau in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ by Egor Skotnikov and Klauber became canonical. The engraving by J. A. Atkinson in the English edition of Krusenshtern's _Voyage_ is poorer and more schematic. It simplifies many details of the tattoo, especially on the torso. The differences between the Göttingen coloured drawing and the engraving in the _Atlas_ are more important – the tattoos, though uniform in general, have numerous divergences, especially in the middle and lower part of the torso, which cannot be explained by simplification, as in Atkinson's variant, but most likely resulted from the engravers' exercise of artistic licence. Moreover, Tilesius' drawing of Mufau's head is quite different from the full-length representations. Thus, despite this rich iconography of a particular person, it is impossible to say which, if any, of the representations corresponded most closely to past actuality. In principle, however, greater verisimilitude is to be assumed in an artist's field sketches and then in his reworked drawings than in engravings.

It was not by chance that Mufau was depicted among the members of Keatonui's family. The visitors learned that he was the 'firemaker at the king's', that is, the queen's _pekio_, 'secondary husband'. At the same time Krusenshtern remarked several times on Mufau's glory as 'the strongest and most intrepid' warrior.[21](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-21) At the end of the eighteenth century, according to Crook, 'the chief's Pekkeyo' was 'Paienue' (Peueinui), a member of the _tapu_, 'restricted', 'forbidden', class who owned large properties; he was also _toa_, 'head warrior', in the Tei'i tribe. As Nicholas Thomas argued, however,

Crook . . . noted that a _pekio_ came to 'belong' as much to the husband, or the husband's part of the family, as to the wife and the wife's, and this perhaps explains why Peueinui was spoken of as Keatonui's _pekio_. The roles of chief and head warrior were sometimes shared by the same individual, which perhaps explains why the ornaments which Peueinui wore into battle actually belonged to Keatonui. . . . It was exceptional for a prominent man such as a head warrior to act as a _pekio_.[22](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-22)

It is therefore tempting to identify 'Mufau Taputa-kava' with Peueinui because Mufau, according to the Russians, combined the duties of _pekio_ with a prominent position in Keatonui's household and was an outstanding warrior (the Russians did not record the word _toa_). The only contradictory detail is Langsdorff's impression that Mufau was 20 years old in 1804 – thus it is doubtful that he could have been _toa_ in 1798 during Crook's visit – although Shemelin was less definite, referring to him as 'a young islander', and Loewenstern called him 'a big lad'.[23](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-23) Moreover, the fact that his intricate tattoo seems to have been complete at the time of the Russians' visit suggests that he must by then have been older than 20.

Finally, among the depictions of the important male members of Keatonui's family is a full-face head, shoulders and chest portrait – the sixth man in the upper row of plate XV in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ (illus. 30). The original drawing by Tilesius in his sketchbook has the inscription 'Omau Dei der Neffe des Königes aus Hikahiwa' (that is, the king's nephew) (illus. 33). I identify him as Mouwateie, the husband of Keatonui's daughter Tahatapu and the son of the chief of Hapa'a valley, rather than as a nephew of the 'king'. Tilesius said of him: 'the king's nephew, of whom, as well as of other members of the King's family, I have drawn a portrait, was always dressed in a bast mat instead of cloth'. Krusenshtern seems to have written about the same man: 'Mats are sometimes used among them, and the king's son-in-law, though he indeed was the only person, always came to the ship in one of a very coarse kind'.[24](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-24) He added:

fortunate union has set the inhabitants of Tayo Hoae at peace with those of another valley in the interior, the king of which is called Mau-day ['MauDei' in the Russian original], (signifying head of the warriors) . . . He married the daughter of Kettenowee, and as no naval war can be carried on between them, they live in a state of perfect peace. Mau-day was almost always in Tayo Hoae, and after Mau-ha-u and Bauting was the handsomest man we saw; he was likewise one of our daily guests.[25](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-25)

Fortunately, the iconography of Mouwateie is not limited to Tilesius' drawing and the engraving based on it. I believe that this 'handsome' man was the model for Langsdorff's full-length portrait published in his _Voyages_ as 'An Inhabitant of the Island of Nukahiwa' – this is one of the most celebrated of all portraits of tattooed Nuku Hivans (illus. 37). Langsdorff commented that it was:

engraved from designs made upon the spot, that the most accurate idea possible might be given of so singular an art. The portrait here delineated is of a man about thirty years of age, a period at which the figures formed by the punctures appear the most distinctly. In later years, one figure is made over another, till the whole becomes confused, and the body assumes a Negro-like appearance, as may be observed in the stripe across the belly.[26](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-26)

Loewenstern also made two full-length drawings that I identify as Mouwateie. In one, he is holding a spear and in the other he is preparing to throw it (illus. 38 and 39). And finally Tilesius created a new drawing of a seated Mouwateie which was engraved for his publication in the _Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung_ in 1805. The coloured engraving is at the National Library of Australia (illus. 40). Later Tilesius wrote that the Islander depicted was 'Omaudei, nephew of king Kettenue'.[27](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-27)

These five portraits of one man made by three artists who were simultaneously in the field depict a number of crucial elements of his tattoo in similar fashion: the shield on the chest with two ovals on the sides; similar ovals on the shoulders; the 'necklace'; the thickly tattooed 'neck-collar' with an opening at the front; and the line across the nose evolving into a darkened segment on the lower left part of the face. Langsdorff's and Loewenstern's drawings are also similar in the composition of the torso and leg decorations. But a precise look at the tattoo elements reveals numerous discrepancies. For instance, the shape and contents of the chest shield change from picture to picture; the content of the ovals also changes; one 'necklace' triples (even in different drawings by the same artist). The black eye that is present in four drawings is absent from the most detailed bust portrait by Tilesius. At the same time, only the latter portrait has an unusual sign resembling an anchor in a semicircle on the forehead. The engraving of 'Omaudei' illustrating Tilesius' German article is the most controversial. The text targeted a broad readership and was sprinkled with exotic tales, while the motifs depicted in the engraving are a concoction of fantasies, particularly the spirals and concentric circles on the torso. This engraving diverges dramatically from Tilesius' original sketch of 'Omau Dei'.

This abundant and varied iconography of one man is a rare case in the history of early representations of Polynesian tattoo. Similar to the case of Mufau, each of these portraits taken in isolation seems reliable. But juxtaposition of different media and different artists' or engravers' impressions of the same person raises serious doubts about the precision of the tattoo motifs depicted. Later researchers have uncritically taken for granted the accuracy of tattoo elements reproduced in the best known of the engravings – Tilesius's 'Omaudei' and Langsdorff's 'An Inhabitant of the Island of Nukahiwa' (illus. 40 and 37) – and have painstakingly analysed them as exact images of 'traditional' tattoo.[28](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-28) At most, however, such representations can be taken as approximate variations on a theme and one can only surmise which, if any, is the most naturalistic. This is indeed an instance of the biblical maxim 'He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow' – or at least uncertainty. It raises serious theoretical questions about the validity of overly literal interpretation of the detail depicted in representations of Polynesian tattoo produced in the pre-photographic era.

Finally, I consider portraits of Marquesan women made by the Russian artists and speculate on who might have been their prototypes. Tilesius' sketchbook contains four fine gouaches of women. The first is 'Ukea Wahini Nuku Hivan aristocrat', drawn with her head and breast draped in cloth (illus. 41). This portrait was later engraved with tattooed lips in plate xv of Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ (illus. 30). The second is 'Nuku Hivan with Palm Branch', depicted with the tattooed inner side of the wrist (illus. 42). The third is 'Titkia Wobusi Nuku Hivan girl in ball attire', shown without tattoo.[29](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-29) The final portrait is 'Woman in Yellow Cloth' drawn with tattooed hand and wrist (illus. 43). This watercolour became an engraving in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ with tattoo added to the lips (illus. 44).

Tilesius's focus on depicting the principal members of Keatonui's family permits us to surmise that these drawings also represented close relatives of the 'king'. Keatonui's wife, Teheatioa, can be excluded, since the elaborate tattoo on her hand elsewhere copied by Langsdorff did not coincide at all with the wrist tattoos shown in the four portraits.[30](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-30) Moreover, according to the anecdotal evidence of an anonymous man from the _Neva_, 'she was around forty, and all her attractive charms had deserted her already'.[31](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-31) Keatonui's daughter and daughter-in-law seem more likely models for these watercolours. Krusenstern said about them:

The king's daughter, a young woman of about twenty-four years of age, and his daughter-in-law, who seemed a few years younger, were both of a remarkably good appearance, which even in Europe would not have been denied. . . . Their bodies . . . were neither coloured nor tatooed; but half of the arm and hand was tatooed black and yellow, which gave them the appearance of short gloves, such as our ladies used formerly to wear.[32](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-32)

The daughter was probably Tahatapu, the wife of Mouwateie, who lived at the time of the Russian visit in Keatonui's household and was the subject of drawings by Tilesius and others. More mysterious is the identity of the daughter-in-law, who was mentioned by several of the Russians. According to Krusenstern, Keatonui's son was 'married to the daughter of the king of the Taipihs' (Taipi) and she was brought to Taiohae by sea, thereby stopping sea warfare between the two tribes. Lisiansky added: 'The handsomest of my party was certainly the Goddess, whose name was Anataena. She was a daughter of the king of another bay in the island, called Houmé, and owed her title of divinity to her marriage'.[33](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-33) According to the anonymous Russian, when visiting the _Neva_ she and Keatonui's daughter 'were taken away by the officers to their cabins where they with special delight gave themselves to their will', while '"the Queen" was outraged that she was not given such a private audience being too old'.[34](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-34) Moreover, there are grounds to believe that 'the Goddess' was Lisiansky's choice. Lisiansky's 'Anataena' must have been Henateiane of Ho'oumi, the wife of Keatonui's eldest son, Duetowa. She was described by Crook as a middle-aged woman with numerous _pekios_. Either she was still very attractive in 1804, six years after Crook's visit, or Crook overestimated her age. I conclude that Tilesius' solemn-looking 'Nuka Hivan aristocrat' was Tahatapu, Keatonui's daughter, and that his 'Woman in yellow cloth' was inspired by Henateiane. In both the drawing and the engraving based on it, Henateiane is depicted as playful and attractive, though with a slight double chin, perhaps denoting that she was no longer young. Interestingly, the drawing and the engraving differ significantly in their depiction of her arm and hand tattoo. The less elaborate pattern shown in the drawing is presumably more naturalistic, while more intricate elements were probably added to the engraving as ethnographic information.

This novel capacity to identify the rich portrait iconography of the first Russian expedition to Nuku Hiva with historical personages who resided in the Taiohae, Hapa'a and Ho'oumi valleys and whose genealogies are well known is an important breakthrough in the ethno-historical exploration of Marquesan tattoo and society generally. It permits a more detailed and informed examination of tattoo designs from particular family, social and territorial settings. At the same time, the analysis of discrepancies between different portraits of the same person in a variety of genres permits some discrimination between more and less naturalistic representations of tattoo patterns.

Shifting emphasis from visual to written representations of tattooed Marquesans, Russian textual accounts again suggest that different observers saw the same things differently. With respect to perceptions, the episode of the first encounter is telling. Entering Taiohae Bay, the _Nadezhda_ sent two yawls forward. They were approached by a canoe apparently crewed by 'natives', one of whom came aboard the yawl and returned to the ship. That 'native' was Edward Robarts, an English beachcomber, who described himself at that moment:

They took me out of the canoe into the boat. The officer gave me a bit of red cloth, a few fish hooks & some nails, he thinking I was a native. This diverted me, nor did I undeceive them untill after I got on board. My beard was very long; it coverd my breast, for I had not been shaved for about 3 years. My skin [was] tanned with the sun. No one on board thought but that I was a native.[35](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-35)

It was his beard and the colour of his skin, he believed, that deceived the visitors. But other features struck the observers more forcefully. Shemelin wrote in his journal: 'The Lieutenant [Golovachev] reaching the ship introduced the savage to the Captain. We all looked at the newcomer, who was speckled over his body by brownish-blue geometrical figures, perpendicular and slanting lines and strips, triangles, quadrangles with different patterns inside, spots and lattices'.[36](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-36) Several others reported similar impressions: 'The boat came alongside the ship; all the natives were naked and speckled with patterns, and one of them, entering the ship, surprised us even more when he started to speak English' (Rezanov); 'We were very surprised when we saw among the natives a naked and tattooed Englishman' (Loewenstern); 'He was almost entirely naked, having only a narrow girdle tied round his middle, and was tatooed on the breast' (Espenberg).[37](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-37) Tilesius remembered another feature: Robarts kept his letter of introduction from an English captain 'tied with two knots in his hair as is customary among the natives'. In his earliest published account, Tilesius described him as 'a man of medium stature, not painted [i.e., not tattooed], though his hair was dressed the same as the natives, naked with a loincloth in front'.[38](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-38) What is remarkable in these accounts is the discrepancy concerning Robarts's tattoo. Moreover, in describing this encounter Krusenshtern, Langsdorff and Ratmanov did not mention his tattoo at all, while the Japanese on board the ship referred to Robarts and Cabri, a French beachcomber, as 'two fair-haired men completely different from the natives'.[39](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-39) These discrepancies exemplify the well-known phenomenon that eyewitness testimonies of the same event can vary wildly, especially when people confront the unusual in an agitated state of mind.

Even later, when the excitement of the first meeting had subsided and more dispassionate observation might have been expected, the two most reliable observers – Langsdorff and Tilesius – produced very different accounts of Robarts's tattoo. According to Langsdorff's well-known voyage narrative, Robarts 'had only a puncture on his breast, in the form of a long square, six inches one way and four the other', the sign of belonging to Keatonui's retinue.[40](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-40) In a much later work of natural history published in Russian, Tilesius described Robarts in terms sharply at odds both with Langsdorff's narrative and his own early published ethnography. By this account, Robarts had a fish tattooed on his body together with the 'figure of a heart pierced by an arrow, which he ordered to be done by the day of his marriage'. Otherwise, apart from the fish, he 'had no other usual Nukahivan decorations, which covered the whole body of the Frenchman [Cabri]'.[41](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-41) This example, as with that of the five different portraits of Mowateie discussed above, demonstrates the instability of voyagers' testimonies, both written and pictorial.

Surrounded by tattooed people, the Russians reflected widely on this custom in their accounts. A few well-educated members of the expedition, acquainted with earlier travellers' accounts, were prepared for the encounter with 'speckled bodies', but for many it was something new. Lisiansky admitted: 'This custom seemed strange to me at first, but finally familiarity overcame prejudice and the motley bodies of the islanders seemed very beautiful to me'.[42](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-42) Indeed, the word 'beautiful' recurs in Russian accounts. 'The natives have remarkably beautiful tattoo', Loewenstern recorded in his diary after the first encounter.[43](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-43) Russian textual accounts, which I do not discuss here in detail, supplement the iconography and indicate their general impressions as well as contributing valuable remarks on tattoo designs. They particularly commented on differences in tattoo depending on gender, age and social status and on the actual procedure of tattooing.

Finding themselves in a society where tattooing was one of the most important personal attributes, the Russian voyagers were tempted to try it themselves. Russian sailors, unlike British, French and American ones, had not yet been seduced by this relatively new fashion due to the general isolation of Russia. The word tattoo itself was still almost unknown in Russia. Reading their accounts, we can literally witness the inception of this novel practice among them.

On the third day after the Russian arrival, Loewenstern recorded in his journal: 'Today I had a tattoo done on my arm. The natives are very artful in this business.' Three days later he remarked: 'Tattooing becomes more and more popular on our ship. The native works from morning till night. Even Krusenshtern had a tattoo done.'[44](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-44) Krusenshtern, though not commenting directly about his own experience, wrote in his narrative: 'There are some great masters in this craft among Nuku Hivans. One of them, being aboard the ship during all our stay here, found a lot of employment for himself, as almost all the men invited him to have a pattern done in accordance with his art'.[45](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-45) Tilesius wrote in 1806: 'One of the artists often visited our ship and nearly all sailors and even some of our officers and travellers had different figures made on them'.[46](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-46) Langsdorff wrote that 'this new experience enthralled' nearly everyone on board.[47](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-47) Ratmanov's journal was especially detailed:

Many of our officers and men had small figures tattooed on their hands and arms. The captain had an inscription done on his arm: Illie [Julie] – the name of his wife whom he adores. I had the inscription done in a semicircle over the left breast above the heart: 'Je suis à vous' – 'I am yours'. All officers felt pain. But I, having given my heart to you, my angel, was so excited making this sacrifice to you in this remote and savage part of the world, my darling, that I did not feel pain and felt that underneath the trembling heart says: 'Yes, I really belong to her'.[48](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-48)

Such conventional inscriptions comprised a significant proportion of the designs. Tilesius added that the tattooist would copy words written for him in Russian and Roman characters.[49](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-49) Obviously, the use of textual inscriptions to express emotional attachments was a usual procedure for the Russians, although presumably not in the form of tattooing.

At the same time, there is evidence that the variety of tattooed designs was not limited to such inscriptions. Ratmanov wrote about 'small figures', Krusenshtern about 'patterns done in accordance with' natives' art.[50](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-50) Tilesius, observing the tattooists' work aboard the ship, recorded: 'I even saw often that he, without any pattern, just out of his head, would punctuate figures known to him'.[51](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-51) Langsdorff mentioned that the visitors 'would have tattooed a bracelet, a name or a figure as a memento'. He himself, according to Tilesius, had tattooed on his arm a figure called 'Te ioe hinenau' (_te a'ahinea'o_), a love symbol, which Langsdorff described ethnographically as a 'sign of wishing to be loved'.[52](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-52) These remarks suggest that indigenous Nuku Hivan patterns were also favoured.

Especially interesting in this respect is the story of Count Fedor Ivanovich Tolstoy, a first cousin once removed of the great novelist Leo Tolstoy, who characterized him as 'an extraordinary personality, immoral and attractive'. Fedor Tolstoy was well known among the Russian aristocracy, being a hero, sometimes a negative hero, of numerous works by Russian poets and writers including Pushkin, Griboedov and Leo Tolstoy himself. While serving in the army, he was famous for his 'wild existence of drinking, gambling, womanising and extravagant exploits of every sort'.[53](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-53) Being one of the most celebrated Russian duellists, he used the opportunity to join Krusenshtern's expedition to flee troubles stemming from a duel with his commanding officer. Incidentally, he was taken aboard instead of another Tolstoy – Fedor Petrovich – who later became a famous painter. Nevertheless, Tolstoy also brought an artwork back from the expedition – his own body tattooed all over, for reasons about which one can only speculate. Leo Tolstoy, who knew the count and even wanted to write a book about him, wrote in 1865 of 'that Tolstoyan wildness that's common to us all. Not for nothing did Fedor Ivanovich have himself tattooed'.[54](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-54)

Having been left at Kamchatka because of a confrontation with Krusenshtern, Tolstoy had many adventures in the north Pacific region. According to numerous anecdotes, he was for some time a 'king' of the Tlingits of south-eastern Alaska, but finally he chose to return to Russia via Siberia. The Tolstoy family history records that 'In the province of Kazan his arrival was recorded by an eyewitness, who recalled his amazement at encountering the wild figure, tattooed from head to foot and dressed in the weather-stained uniform of the Preobrazhensky Guards, in which apparently he had led the Tlinkits on their walrus-hunts'.[55](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-55) Tolstoy's tales about his northern experience earned him the title 'Tolstoy the American', but, since I have found no documentary evidence of his actual stay with native Americans, I speculate that part at least of his intricate tattoo might well have been done by a Nuku Hivan artist.

On reaching St Petersburg, he was apt to display his newly decorated body, which presumably had a significant impact in awakening public interest to tattooing. His niece, Maria Kamenskaia, remembered one such exhibition:

He undid his shirt-studs, and bared and swelled out his chest. Everyone at the table stood up in their places and gazed attentively at it: it was completely covered in tattoos. In the very middle sat in a ring some sort of big multi-coloured bird, rather like a parrot, in a red and blue hoop . . . both arms were likewise completely tattooed, with snakes and other wild designs entwined around them. The ladies sighed and gasped without ceasing, and asked solicitously: 'Wasn't it very painful, Count, when those savages tattooed you? How did they pick out the designs? Oh, what suffering!'[56](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-56)

This account is interesting because Kamenskaia might have misinterpreted the actual images tattooed on Tolstoy's body. It is unfair to expect an accurate account of an extensive body tattoo from a person overwhelmed by the sensory experience of seeing it for the first time. We have already seen this in the case of Robarts's tattoo.

But tattooing did indeed start to capture public imagination. Another 'promoter' of tattoo in Russia was the French beachcomber Jean-Baptiste Cabri, who left Nuku Hiva with Krusenshtern's expedition; he had indigenous Marquesan tattoos all over his body. According to Langsdorff,

The extraordinary fate of this man, and the novel appearance of his tattooed body, attracted the attention of every one. Both at Moscow and at St Petersburg he exhibited upon the stage the dances of the savages, and was considered by all the great people of the country as a real curiosity.

Finally, 'his dexterity in swimming, in which he is scarcely excelled by the natives of Nuka Hiwa themselves, has procured him the appointment of teacher of swimming to the corps of marine cadets at Cronstadt'.[57](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-57) Presumably his tattoos stirred the imagination of aristocrats and young cadets alike. Furthermore, during the nineteenth century tattoo also became an almost universal fashion among Russian seamen, in spite of their relative isolation from the Western open markets for seamen's labour.

This study enables the attribution of celebrated images of Nuku Hivans to particular artists and brings to light a number of unknown portraits. The juxtaposition of different images with each other and with textual accounts helps to establish genealogies of the visual representations and to identify some of their subjects with known historical personages, thus opening a field for further ethno-historical explorations. Comparative analysis of the textual material contributes complementary information: on tattooing itself, on the ways in which it was perceived by the Russian visitors, and on the tattoo mania that seized them in Nuku Hiva, together with its metropolitan aftermath.

# CHAPTER THREE

## Marks of Transgression: The Tattooing of Europeans in the Pacific Islands

Joanna White

During James Cook's third and final voyage to the Pacific, John Ledyard, corporal of the marines on board the _Resolution_, described in his journal a relationship that was struck up between a sailor and a Maori woman during the ships' sojourn in New Zealand. According to Ledyard's version of events, the visiting seaman elected to become tattooed in full conformity with indigenous tradition:

though our sailor appeared amiable in her eyes in the habit of a stranger he was conscious that to ornament his person in the fashion of New Zealand would still recommend him more to his mistress and the country he was in; he therefore submitted himself to be tatowed from head to foot.[1](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-1)

Although Ledyard might have slightly romanticized the scenario,[2](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-2) this account is striking since it demonstrates how elaborate, indigenous forms of tattooing were readily adopted by Europeans at such an early point in the history of their contact with Pacific peoples. Such engagement with the local practice is closely identified with gaining acceptance among Islanders (in this particular case the sailor's adoption of Maori tattooing formed part of a wider strategy for incorporation within the local community, since he later attempted to desert from his ship and take up local residence). Furthermore, this account illustrates how tattooing can be understood as not merely an individual enterprise, but a mutual constitution of human agency and social environment.[3](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-3) The practice can be understood as a product of many factors, including personal and collective relationships, events, obligations and the prevailing social context.[4](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-4)

This chapter will examine the various processes that resulted in some of the Europeans (and later, Americans) who visited the Pacific in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries electing to become tattooed as a result of their contact with indigenous peoples. By exploring the diverse motivations that led to individuals irreversibly transforming their bodies, the motifs they chose to have inscribed, and the meaning(s) that this process and its outcome held for them, new insight can be gained into the role of tattooing in both shaping and communicating personal and social identities. The ways in which tattooing was perceived in different cultural contexts and the impact of Pacific encounters on European tattooing traditions during this period will also be discussed.

Although encounters between explorers, sailors and Pacific Islanders in the late eighteenth century are still popularly understood to have made a significant contribution to modern Western tattooing, recent studies have suggested that exposure to Pacific body modification conventions may have resulted in the reinvigoration of a long-standing, though historically inconsistent, tradition rather than constituting the origins of the practice in Europe.[5](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-5) It is now broadly accepted that British sailors were already engaging in voluntary[6](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-6) tattooing in the second half of the eighteenth century, although evidence of this practice remains sparse. Records from the Marine Society and 'description books' used to identify employees in London shipyards just after the middle of the eighteenth century, for example, reported occasional cases of boys and men 'mark'd' with their initials or names on their hand, wrist or arm.[7](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-7) The relative scarcity of such references – among copious records – indicates that this practice was not widespread, and was likely to have been customary only among a minority of sailors and those with associations with the sea-faring world, rather than belonging to a linear tradition.

The excitement stimulated among Europeans when they first encountered Pacific tattooing is apparent from the elaborate descriptions of the aesthetic content, visual effects and the technical methods of tattooing reported in contemporary accounts, as well as Sydney Parkinson's striking drawings of this practice, which were produced during Cook's first voyage. The publication of these works ensured that knowledge of Pacific tattooing spread swiftly among the literate classes of Europe.[8](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-8) Yet the place of tattooing within indigenous cosmologies and its importance as a socializing and empowering process, expressive of adulthood, status and group membership (in ways that differed across location), was grasped only partially during this early stage of contact. What travellers were unwittingly exposed to during their voyages to the Pacific was not merely a prolific and sophisticated form of body modification, but tattooing as an _institution_, a prescribed practice that performed a specific, historical function in the maintenance and reproduction of local social systems.

Despite their limited understanding of the local significance of tattooing, however, European interest in Oceanic body modification practices extended beyond mere observation; practical engagement was almost immediate. From Cook's first voyage onwards, there is evidence that visitors to the Pacific Islands became tattooed as a direct result of their contact with indigenous peoples, although, as will be elaborated below, early voyagers, sailors and those who were resident in Pacific societies for prolonged periods engaged with local tattooing traditions in quite distinct ways. Indeed, the various forms in which Europeans adopted the body modification methods they observed in the Pacific expose the heterogeneous nature of the cross-cultural exchange that took place during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as well as the varying appeal that tattooing held for different individuals.

Journals from the period revealed how, for the gentlemen professionals and some of the sailors who travelled on board ships to the Pacific, the experience of being tattooed was a novel activity, engaged in out of curiosity. The indigenous tattooing motifs that were chosen to be marked on the skin served both as permanent, ornamental souvenirs of voyaging and evidence of encounters with Pacific peoples.[9](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-9) Frederick Bennett, a surgeon on board a whaling ship in the 1830s, for example, described visiting Raiatea, one of the Society Islands,

while at this island, I gratified a wish to observe the process and effects of the tatoo by having a figure thus impressed upon myself. The artist I engaged was a Tahitian; and from the numerous patterns displayed on his person we selected a circular figure, named _pote_; the spot I preferred devoting to the impression was the upper arm.[10](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-10)

Early encounters in Tahiti in the second half of the eighteenth century appear to have had a different impact on many sailors, however. Seamen often employed local tattooists not only to inscribe their skin with local motifs, but to mark initials, names and dates on the hand or the arm.[11](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-11) Hence, encounters with Pacific tattooing did not necessarily result in the desire to replicate indigenous styles; instead local expertise was rapidly applied to the reproduction of an existing practice, which, as described earlier, would have been familiar to some sailors, that of marking familiar personal references on one's body. Such forms of tattooing became a convention among sailors that persisted well into the nineteenth century. Indeed, the tattooing of initials during this period has been described as the equivalent of dog tags, providing a means of identification and thereby offering insurance against an anonymous burial, a particular risk for mobile populations such as sailors, who might be lost in a shipwreck or die in a foreign country.[12](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-12)

There is also evidence, however, that exposure to tattooing practices in the Pacific Islands contributed to sailors' understanding of the potential for tattoos to express collective relationships, which led to their imitation of this practice. This is revealed in the account of John Elliott, a midshipman on the _Resolution_ during Cook's second voyage. Elliott reported in his journal how observation of the elite group _arioi_ in Borabora in the Society Islands inspired him and his messmates to adopt the same motif, which distinguished _arioi_ from other Islanders:[13](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-13)

all our Mess conceived the idea of having some mark put on ourselves, as connecting us together, as well as to commemorate our having been at Otaheite. For which purpose we determined on having a compleat Star drawn and then tattowed with black, the same way as the Natives are tat-towed, upon our left Breast, and painful as this operation was, we all underwent it, and have each a very handsome Black Star on our left Breast, the size of a Crown Piece.[14](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-14)

Here the design adopted was multi-referential, serving as a souvenir of the sailors' voyage, as well as a permanent symbol of an exclusive relationship between the men, in this case identification with one's mess – often sailors would be messmates for many years.[15](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-15) The dual expressive potential of tattooing, to mark both personal experiences and social ties, clearly appealed, resulting in an indigenous collective practice being appropriated and transformed through its adoption within a new social milieu.

Later in his account Elliott revealed how, as a result of the tattooed messmates being observed bathing by other members of the crew, the trend 'spread halfway through the ship'. The original intention behind Elliot and his companions' particular adoption of the local practice was thereby destabilized, since the motif was hijacked and became the marker of a wider group among the crew.[16](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-16) Such ready commandeering and rapid diffusion of a Pacific motif is striking, and confirms the particular appeal that tattooing held for sailors and the potential speed at which this practice could spread among them. Alfred Gell proposed that mariners' interest in tattooing stemmed from its potential to express their class position, lifestyle or their unique _habitus_, that is, world views that were products of their social location and manifest in their personal habits and preferences. Therefore, on encountering tattooing in the Pacific, sailors rapidly 'made it their own'.[17](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-17) Greg Dening described how

The essence of a sailor's existence was to be utterly without space he could call his own, to have all his possessions calculated narrowly, to be a totally public man to his peers and to be totally public to superiors who could muster him twice daily at his quarters.[18](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-18)

Living under such constrained circumstances, in a confined and unpredictable social world and isolated from friends and family, sailors found in tattooing a unique means of reaffirming both their individual identities and their personal relationships. In contrast with their controlled, shipboard life, the marking of the body offered them an unrestrained and autonomous space for both private and public expression. Since seamen lived in close proximity to one other and shared experiences at close quarters, such innovative means of self-expression are likely to have diffused exponentially throughout the seafaring world. Similarly, the practice is understood to have attracted and diffused among another marginalized group that came into contact with mariners: transported convicts.[19](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-19)

Descriptions of the _Bounty_ mutineers recorded by William Bligh in 1789 indicate how, two decades after Cook's first voyage, the adoption of tattooing was already a growing phenomenon among sailors. Indeed, in his inclusion of tattoos for crew identification purposes, Bligh unknowingly pre-empted a trend that emerged in the navy over the coming decades and became formalized practice by the 1830s. That tattooing was common among everyday seamen who had travelled to the Pacific, and visible within their own particular social world, but might have been less known among their superiors, is evidenced by the fact that Bligh depended on the mutineers' peers for descriptions of the various motifs on the bodies of the individual 'pirates'.[20](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-20)

Twenty-two of the 25 mutineers described by Bligh were tattooed. In some cases details are vague, with individuals referred to as being 'very much tattooed',[21](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-21) but in others more intriguing descriptions are provided. Peter Heywood, for example, was marked with the 'three legs of the Isle of Man', a clear assertion of his Manx nationality. Thomas Ellison was tattooed on his right arm with his name and also with the date, 25 October 1788, the day the _Bounty_ first arrived in Tahiti. He had thereby apparently elected to mark a critical moment in his personal history.[22](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-22) Other mutineers were also marked with their initials, dates or motifs, such as hearts. In common with many of their predecessors, the mutineers therefore appear to have largely employed indigenous expertise to create European motifs, using familiar symbolic and literal references. Innovation also took place. One of the mutineers, Adam Smith, for example, extended the convention of marking initials and dates to the body of his Tahitian lover: his initials and a significant date were tattooed on her arm.[23](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-23) A number of the _Bounty_ mutineers had, however, adopted Tahitian motifs on parts of the body consistent with local convention, including the chest, legs, body, backside and feet. The Tahitian star that had such an impact on Elliott and his messmates, for example, re-emerged on the body of Fletcher Christian. Further innovation can be discerned with regard to the appropriation of Pacific motifs. One of the mutineers was described as being tattooed under the pit of his stomach with the ornamental design of the _taumi_, or Tahitian breastplate.[24](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-24) In this case, similar to Heywood's use of the Manx emblem, a familiar schematic or ornamental design had been transferred from material objects to the body through tattooing, a practice that already existed in Western Polynesian tattooing – although, as far as is known, the _taumi_ was not in fact part of the lexicon of indigenous Tahitian tattoo motifs during the period in question. This process, defined by Gell as 'scheme transfer',[25](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-25) had become an identifiable convention in European tattooing by the following century.[26](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-26)

The striking combination of both European and Tahitian markings on the bodies of the mutineers can be understood as a physical registration of a multitude of factors. Indigenous tattooing expertise had been used to assert the sailors' identities, commemorate particular life events, mark personal relationships and express new cultural influences. In sum, the mutineers' engagement in tattooing was a unique reflection of their hybrid associations, both European and Tahitian.[27](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-27)

Naval records held at the Public Record Office in the United Kingdom have documented how permanent body markings had become a significant indicator of a professional seafarer by the 1830s, by which time a growing range of popular motifs had emerged. The tattooing of names, initials and dates and designs such as man, woman and child – a striking symbol of domesticity for those away from home for prolonged periods – were all common. Other motifs that have since become more stereotypical mariners' markings, such as mermaids, anchors, hearts, stars and crucifixes, are also common. Early encounters with Pacific Islanders therefore appear to have made a lasting contribution to Western maritime culture in terms of the adoption of tattooing as popular practice, if not in terms of motif content.

Europeans (and later Americans) who found themselves resident in Pacific communities for an extended period of time in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, both voluntarily or involuntarily, also adopted tattooing as a result of contact with local populations, but in forms more closely related to indigenous convention. The term 'beachcomber' was coined to describe individuals who spent long periods living on Pacific islands. These included deserters, discharged crew, castaways, captives of ambitious local leaders and runaway convicts. A number of beachcombers published accounts of their experiences on their return home. Although problematic in many ways as historical records, these diverse accounts nonetheless shed new light on the nature of cross-cultural encounters during the early period of contact, including the interactions and social relationships that resulted in a number of beachcombers becoming tattooed.

From the moment of their arrival, beachcombers found themselves in an ambiguous situation and had little control over their standing or status within the communities among which they found themselves. In Ian Campbell's words, they could be 'used, discarded or destroyed' by Island inhabitants.[28](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-28) James O'Connell, shipwrecked in the Caroline Islands in the 1820s, for example, betrayed his uncertainty at his position when he described being 'adopted' by a local chief soon after his arrival, referring to his patron as 'my new friend, or master, or owner, – I do not know exactly how he considered himself'.[29](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-29) A common experience depicted in both beachcomber narratives (and, indeed, in many voyage accounts of the same period) is the immediate removal by the local population of all the possessions of the new arrivals, including the clothes they were wearing. These prized articles were often appropriated for local use, including exchange purposes. Horace Holden, who was shipwrecked on one of the Palau Islands, described one of the first interactions he and his crewmates had with a local man, 'After pretty thoroughly convincing us that in this case our only course was submission, he began to strip us of our clothing.'[30](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-30) This removal of clothing by local people may be interpreted as an immediate attempt by Islander hosts to force new arrivals to conform to local codes of conduct. In their introduction to the journal of William Lockerby, a sandalwood trader who was resident in the Fiji Islands, for example, Everard ImThurn and Leonard Wharton proposed that the practice of relieving shipwrecked sailors of their clothing meant 'no more than that the islanders reduced the clothes of their visitors to that which they thought proper for themselves'.[31](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-31) Whatever motivations prompted such treatment, this literal stripping of the trappings of European civilization exposed the physical vulnerability of beachcombers within their new cultural setting.

Given their uncertain position, establishing useful allegiances and a recognizable role for themselves was vital for beachcombers' comfortable existence, and even their survival.[32](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-32) While new arrivals were often accorded similar status among local communities as they were perceived to hold in their own, based on indicators such as dress and apparent position in the ship hierarchy,[33](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-33) conversely, those with no immediately recognizable status often found themselves at a disadvantage, open to ridicule and abuse and even living with restricted access to food.[34](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-34) Those who held skills in areas that were prized by Pacific communities, such as the employment and maintenance of firearms, the production of iron, the use of razors, or even the playing of musical instruments or dancing, found themselves able to exploit these talents and use them to establish firmer reciprocal relationships with Islanders.[35](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-35) Indeed, Vanessa Smith even argues that the treatment of beachcombers with aptitude in certain practical skills often constituted an inversion of the prevailing system of class and status in Europe, due to the consequent prestige and authority awarded to visitors who were manually gifted.[36](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-36) As John Twyning, shipwrecked on Vatoa, one of the Lau Islands of Fiji, in 1829 described, he and his crew-mates provided valued services to their chiefly host:

If we staid at home we were employed in furbishing his firearms and keeping them in repair. The service of one or other of us was sure to be required whenever his highness wished to be shaved, because he conceived a white man could perform this operation more dexterously than a native.[37](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-37)

In some cases, the novel skills that beachcombers offered provided such individuals with one of their few sources of leverage among their adopted communities. William Diapea, who was resident in Fiji towards the middle of the nineteenth century, for example, related how he resisted the treatment he received as he was paraded as a novelty, the _manu manu_ (pet bird), of a chief in the Islands, by refusing to repair muskets, a task usually assigned to him.[38](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-38) Several narratives detailed beachcombers' attempts to hoard their practical skills and prevent native people from learning them, a phenomenon that underlines how often the foreign visitors were highly aware of the tenuousness of their position.[39](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-39)

During this early contact period, the balance of power with respect to lone individuals or small groups of men isolated from the security of their ships lay firmly with the indigenous population. New arrivals were admitted into communities conditionally by people convinced of the correctness of their own social codes.[40](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-40) As a consequence, local norms of behaviour were frequently imposed upon beachcombers. Dening claimed that the participation of officers and sailors who were merely transient visitors in indigenous rituals such as name-exchange could be considered a fiction, a game to be played with mock solemnity. However, beachcombers who were resident for longer periods were faced with the social consequences and obligations of their incorporation within local communities.[41](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-41) This is exemplified in accounts of the pressure that was exerted on new residents to conform to local norms governing the treatment of the body. In addition to the removal of clothing, many narratives detailed how newcomers were pressurized to remove their facial and body hair in conformity with indigenous aesthetic values concerning physical appearance. In a number of cases, their bodies became sites of enforced transformation, as their facial hair was extracted using pearl-shells.[42](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-42)

Similarly, tattooing was presented in a number of the narratives as a process that beachcombers were pressurized to undergo. A common theme emerges of both coercion and encouragement from native people, which resulted in conformity on the part of beachcombers. Holden, for example, described the experiences of being tattooed that he shared with his crewmates during their stay at the Palau Islands:

To our sorrow, we were . . . compelled to conform to the custom . . . and shall carry with us to the grave the marks of the well-meant, though cruel operations upon our bodies.[43](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-43)

Holden's reference to the practice being 'well-meant' conveys his understanding of the importance placed on such conformity to local people. Indeed, given the significance of tattooing in many Pacific societies, the pressure placed on beachcombers by Islanders to have their bodies similarly marked is likely to have been considerable. Such indigenous agency in the tattooing of foreign visitors needs to be understood in both cosmological and social terms. For many of the communities among which the beachcombers resided, tattooing was a fundamental cultural practice, vital to social reproduction. Those who did not conform to this process were either pre-adolescent, of very low class or, on rare occasions in locations such as Tonga, those of the highest rank, closest to the deities. In his comprehensive analysis of tattooing in Polynesia, Gell emphasized the importance of tattooing in making a person 'whole' in many Pacific societies. Being tattooed at adolescence was a process of desanctification, rendering individuals 'safe' to engage in adult activities such as sexual and exchange relations (although particular modes of tattooing, when and to whom they applied and their social meaning varied from location to location).[44](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-44) It could therefore be argued that beachcombers who were not tattooed, and yet resided in Pacific communities and sought to engage in social relationships, did not 'fit' into any clear category. Their socially _un_integrated bodies were an overt and constant transgression of cultural norms. In contrast, by becoming tattooed through accepted ritualistic processes, a cosmologically 'safer' and more coherent position could be established for them.

The pressure placed on beachcombers to become tattooed was therefore a consequence of their residence, a process they were required to undergo not only to become more viable members of their host societies but to mark the status assigned to them or the status to which they aspired through their attempts to forge meaningful relationships. Several narratives explicitly detailed the role that becoming tattooed played in the assimilation of foreign visitors. Joseph Kabris, a Frenchman who resided in the Marquesas Islands from 1796 to 1804 as a result of being shipwrecked along with other crewmates, described their early experiences as follows:

For about four months we were treated with great deference and care by the islanders. At this time the _quaitenouiy_[45](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-45) urged us to be tattooed all over, which these people regard as a mark of manhood . . . After the ceremony, which made us belong to the tribe, we each chose a wife and were married according to the islanders' custom.[46](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-46)

For Kabris and his crewmates, becoming tattooed was clearly a significant rite of passage that established their membership of the group. Similarly, O'Connell related how he and his crewmate were pressurized to be tattooed and were removed from public society for a number of days in order for the process to be completed. As a result of his pragmatic submission, O'Connell described how he emerged 'a bird of much more diversified plumage than when I entered, being tattooed on my left hand, on both arms, legs, thighs, back and abdomen'.[47](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-47) As in the case of Kabris, immediately on the completion of this process the two men were married to local women. In fact, the extent to which they willingly acceded to being tattooed appears to have defined their future status among their hosts, since O'Connell went on to explain how in the case of his crewmate 'his unwillingness to submit to the process of tattooing wedded him to a woman of no rank'.[48](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-48) Hence, whether they were aware of it or not, by consenting to be tattooed beachcombers were providing themselves with important symbolic capital.[49](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-49)

Tattooing was simultaneously a product and an expression of the beachcombers' social relationships within Pacific communities. In the case of Kabris, for example, many of the tattoos depicted in Alexander Orlovsky's celebrated drawing of him, engraved by R. Cooper for the English edition of Georg von Langsdorff's narrative of the Russian voyage to the Marquesas Islands in 1804 (illus. 46), evidently related to his status in the Islands: the partial facial mask indicated his title as a son-in-law;[50](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-50) a breastplate on the right breast signified his standing as a warrior;[51](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-51) and the tattooed eye marked his membership of a specific feasting society.[52](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-52)

A crucial feature of the beachcomber's experience was his ability to resist engaging in practices that he found morally abhorrent, such as cannibalism and infanticide, and his frequent transgression of other local codes of behaviour – whether knowingly or otherwise – with relatively little redress. Indeed, in some cases beachcombers even found themselves immune to or able to resist the sanctions associated with _tapu_.[53](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-53) Some voyage accounts and a number of beachcomber narratives emphasized European resistance to indigenous codes concerning the treatment of the body, for example, particularly concerning the baring of the individual's head and shoulders in the presence of those of chiefly status, a demonstration of deference that was standard practice in many Pacific societies, and heavily punished if not adhered to. Such resistance reflects the importance that many European visitors placed on their own customary norms relating to the body. However, the attempted infringement of such normally non-negotiable codes of behaviour by beachcombers was not always blithely accepted by Islanders. When Morrison and several other _Bounty_ mutineers expressed their desire to meet a young chief in one of the Society Islands, for example, they were told they would not be authorized to see him unless they stripped their clothing from their heads and shoulders. When they refused to do this because they asserted it to be 'not customary' in their native society, they were apparently forced to compromise by placing a cloth over their bare shoulders.[54](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-54)

The extent to which beachcombers were able to resist customary norms of behaviour appears to have depended on the relationship that they were able to cultivate with their chiefly patron(s). Hence William Mariner, who was shipwrecked in Tonga in 1806 and protected by the Vava'u chief Finau, did not conform to the convention of baring his head in the chief's presence. Yet he was regularly reminded of to whom he owed this privilege. As described in the published account,

the king used frequently to tell Mr Mariner, that if he ever met any common fellow with his head covered, he should immediately knock him down. He was, however, like other foreigners, to wear a head-dress without any restriction, as being supposed to be governed by different gods, and accustomed to different manners.[55](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-55)

Given such attempts by some Europeans to cling tenaciously to aspects of their own cultural codes of dress and behaviour, it is likely that the pressure to become tattooed resulted in resistance among some Europeans. As O'Connell's earlier account of his crewmate suggests, a process of negotiation and resistance regarding the process of tattooing is likely to have characterized some encounters. Edward Robarts, an Englishman who was shipwrecked and lived in the Marquesas Islands from late 1797 to 1806, overlapping with Kabris, appears to have demonstrated a much more selective engagement in local practices than his French counterpart. Indeed, European visitors to the Marquesas who met both men were struck with Robarts's limited acquaintance with local language and customs compared with the Frenchman's.[56](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-56) The Englishman's engagement with tattooing was perhaps, therefore, consistent with his more distanced, selective participation in indigenous cultural practices. Most contemporary accounts indicated that he only submitted to being marked on the chest with a motif indicating his membership of a feasting society.[57](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-57) He justified this engagement in tattooing to other visiting Europeans as induced by his need to survive. Joining a feasting group, he claimed, made his life considerably easier.

In contrast, however, many beachcombers engaged willingly – albeit selectively – with indigenous tattooing traditions. This is particularly evident in the case of beachcombers who voluntarily resided among communities in the Pacific Islands over the long-term. Such individuals are remarkable not only because of their enthusiastic participation in local practices but the levels of identification with indigenous culture that ensued. Indeed, it appears that some beachcombers not only deliberately conformed to local manners and customs as a practical strategy but took on local symbolic and cultural references as their own. Joseph Kabris is a striking case in point. Kabris willingly engaged in local networks, forged a recognized place for himself within the chiefly class, married a chief's daughter, successfully engaged in local warfare, and, as described above, bore the tattoos that indicated his status. Essentially 'he became all but Marquesan'.[58](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-58) By the time of his departure on one of the ships from the first Russian voyage to the Pacific, he had virtually forgotten his native French. His identification with Marquesan values was so complete that, when offered a good new shirt, he desired to exchange it for a shabby red jacket, which he prized for its colour in a similar way to other Islanders, among whom red had significant symbolic value. There is every indication that he was removed from the Marquesas Islands by mistake and did not willingly return to Europe.

The fact that it was frequently possible for beachcombers to negotiate non- or partial compliance with certain practices serves to highlight how some individuals deliberately and pragmatically chose to become assimilated, due to the understood benefits that this could bring in terms of their relationships with local people. Tattooing may have been one of the means most available to them to express their commitment to conform. This is evident from the case of the crew member of the _Discovery_, described at the opening of this chapter, who, according to Ledyard, deliberately became tattooed in order to win favour with his New Zealand 'mistress' and her countrymen.

Similarly, Heywood, a _Bounty_ mutineer resident in Tahiti, explained his reasons for being tattooed: 'it was my constant endeavour to acquiesce in any little custom which I thought would be agreeable to them, though painful in the process, provided I gained by it their friendship and esteem'.[59](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-59) While the explanation provided by Heywood is not as straightforward as it might appear (Bligh's description of him, cited earlier, revealed that he had been tattooed with European motifs during his first visit to Tahiti and therefore was clearly engaging in this practice on several levels), it nonetheless reveals how beachcombers conformed to certain behaviour that they knew would facilitate social relationships. Given the often precarious status of beachcombers in their adoptive communities, such means of assimilation would bring definite advantages.

The process whereby beachcombers became tattooed can, therefore, be usefully understood as a convergence of both indigenous and European agency. While some visitors might have deliberately adopted this practice for perceived benefits, such behaviour always took place within a context of indigenous articulation of the significance of tattooing, and, conversely, the negative status of the 'non'-tattooed' within indigenous culture. Many of the narratives of those who became tattooed provided accounts of indigenous attitudes towards those who had not undergone this process, perceptions that presumably had been communicated to the Europeans who fell into this category. Hence Heywood described how in Tahiti a person without tattoos was considered to be 'bearing a most indignant badge of disgrace, and considered as a "mere outcast of society"'.[60](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-60)

Similarly, other beachcombers referred to the 'disgrace' and 'shame' associated with not being tattooed. Holden, for example, elaborated on the perceptions of their Palau Islander hosts towards their foreign visitors: 'to go at large without being tattooed, was to carry with us the palpable proofs of our vulgarity'.[61](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-61) For these individuals, the sense of existing physically against the indigenous scheme of things had clearly been conveyed to them.[62](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-62) Therefore, as Gell argued, beachcombers' choice to adopt tattooing cannot be accounted for in purely European terms. The significance of the practice among indigenous peoples had been transmitted, at least in part, to the resident visitors.[63](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-63) The transformation of beachcombers' bodies was therefore a product not only of their new social relationships, but their sense of themselves within a new cultural setting.

The experiences of George Vason, who was landed on Tongatapu in April 1797 as part of the first missionary enterprise in the region, provide an illustrative example. Soon after his arrival, Vason began to adopt Tongan norms of dress and behaviour, thereby estranging himself from his Christian brethren, who could only hope for his 'recovery'.[64](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-64) The renegade missionary married into a family of chiefly status, became a landowner and participated in the civil wars that burgeoned towards the end of the eighteenth century and eventually forced him to return to Europe. Vason became tattooed relatively late in his residence and represented this process as submission to sustained pressure from the young men with whom he associated, who mocked him for lacking the body markings that all Tongan men were not only expected to bear to demonstrate their manhood but took great pride in displaying.[65](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-65) He finally elected voluntarily to become tattooed after successful engagement in war and the celebration of battle victories, when male pride and exhibitionism was likely to be at its peak and hence the social significance of tattooing among Tongan men at its most explicit. Vason's description of himself once the permanent marking of his body was completed is a uniquely celebratory account; his thrill at his new appearance is palpable, revealing some level of identification with his adopted hosts:

I was very much admired by the natives, as the European skin displays the blue colour, and the ornaments of the tattooing to very great advantage: I looked indeed very gay in this new fancy covering.[66](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-66)

Dening argued that beachcombers existed on the boundaries of two worlds, transgressing social codes in both and belonging to neither.[67](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-67) The precariousness and vulnerability of their status in both worlds often becomes most apparent in their narratives on the arrival of ships bearing representatives of their own native societies. Although many beachcombers forged a role for themselves as mediators between Pacific communities and European and American ships, their position among their compatriots was rarely comfortable. The physical appearance of many of these individuals had often been so transformed through their adoption of local dress and tattoos that it was not uncommon for those on visiting ships to mistake them for Islanders on first encounter.[68](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-68) As Heywood recalled on first meeting European sailors who arrived during his residence on Tahiti, 'being dressed in the country manner, tanned as brown as themselves, and I tattooed like them in the most curious manner, I do not wonder at their taking us for natives'.[69](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-69)

When such cases of mistaken identity were resolved, a negative association was often made between beachcombers' unconventional physical appearance and their moral integrity. Hence, for example, the German naturalist Langsdorff referred to Kabris, whom he encountered during the Russian voyage to the Marquesas Islands early in the nineteenth century, as 'both morally and physically transformed into a savage'.[70](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-70) Such conflation of physical appearance and morality was common in the representation and understanding of indigenous people during the early contact period. Due to the transformation of their bodies, beachcombers were considered 'worse' than natives since they were perceived as having consciously rejected the supposedly civilized values of their home societies. On meeting the beachcomber James Coleman in one of the Sandwich Islands, for example, George Vancouver commented,

He had in most respects adopted the customs of the natives, particularly in dress, or rather in nakedness; for, excepting the _maro_, which he wore with much less decency than the generality of the inhabitants, he was perfectly naked . . . and seemed greatly to exult in having degenerated into a savage way of life.[71](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-71)

Evidently the forms of physical transformation, including tattooing, that had provided markers of inclusion for beachcombers within their adopted Pacific communities, cementing social relationships and enabling them to be more readily assimilated, created a palpable cultural distance between these individuals and their own compatriots. Hence Vason's description of the vulnerability and apprehension he experienced when on board the ship returning him to Europe,

my mind was not at ease . . . and ashamed of my own exposed appearance among those who were more decently clothed (for I was still in want of many articles of dress), I began to reflect on my past strange life and conduct, and look forward with shame and anxiety to a return to my native country.[72](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-72)

The feelings described here by Vason are in striking contrast with his unrestrained _in situ_ enthusiasm for Tongan practices, detailed earlier in his narrative. This account, written after Vason's return to the Church, can partly be understood as an attempt on his part to communicate the shame and remorse he felt his intended readership in 'civilized' society expected from him, due to his from 'fall from grace'. Yet whatever the primary intent behind his narrative, clearly the displacement of his transformed body into a new setting resulted in Vason's sudden awareness of his physical and cultural estrangement from his compatriots, and the implications of this for his return to Europe.

Clothing could be replaced, but tattoos were a permanent marker of beachcombers' residence in the Pacific Islands. They were interpreted by other Europeans as physical symbols of their transgression from and rejection of the values of their native culture. The more visible and irreversible the transformation, the more problematic the individual's reincorporation into his own native society. As one traveller observed in his account of a beachcomber in the Marquesas Islands, which was published in 1838, 'he is tattooed across the face, and will therefore probably never return to England'.[73](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-73) For those who did return home, such as George Bruce, who spent many years living among the Maori at the turn of the eighteenth century, life did not prove easy. In Bruce's appeal to the Treasury of the Royal Navy, he lamented his existence back in England and requested to be allowed to return to the Pacific. The former beachcomber made an explicit link between the treatment he received from 'the lower classes' and the visibility of his tattoos:

Life is a burden to him in this Kingdom. some calls him a Man Eater, another says his is the Devil & others calls him a Traitor To his Country. & this is because he don't sattisfie Them all, with the marks in his face.[74](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-74)

Herman Melville's semi-fictional account of a sailor's experiences in the Marquesas Islands, _Typee_, first published in London in 1847, encapsulated many of the preoccupations of earlier beachcomber narratives.[75](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-75) The protagonist of the novel, Tommo, who deserted his ship in order to live among a Marquesan community, was simultaneously attracted and repelled by the exotic world he saw around him and lived in fear of being destroyed by his adoption of the 'savage' way of life. This dominant theme was captured by Melville in Tommo's descriptions of tattooing that is variably depicted as both elegant, artful and grotesque. Late in his stay, Tommo was pressurized by the local people to have his body marked in what he understood to be a bid to 'convert' him to the indigenous 'religion' of tattooing. He strenuously resisted this pressure.[76](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-76) Tommo's almost hysterical fear of being tattooed on his face and therefore never being able to return and live among his own countrymen is telling, and may betray Melville's knowledge of the experiences of Western men who had adopted indigenous Pacific tattooing and then attempted to reintegrate within their native societies.

Tattooed beachcombers who returned home dealt with their anomalous status in various ways. It could well be argued that the depiction in a number of beachcomber narratives of the adoption of tattoos as an outcome of pressure from indigenous communities was an attempt by returning 'transgressors' to play down their own personal volition in an attempt to avoid alienating their readership. This is likely to be true in the case of John Rutherford, who asserted that the markings on his face and body were a result of his being forcibly tattooed over a period of four hours while being held down by several members of the Maori community among whom he lived for ten years.[77](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-77) Since the varied motifs are indigenous to several different island groups in the Pacific, and the _moko_, or Maori tattooing, borne by Rutherford on his face is usually carried out over a much longer period, his claims have been largely discredited.

The contemporary account of Rutherford's return to England described how he occasionally showed his tattoos in public and recounted his adventures, although he was averse to displaying his body for money.[78](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-78) Other individuals, including Kabris and O'Connell, opportunistically exhibited their tattooed bodies on their return to the metropoles. Indeed, O'Connell might have been the first tattooed man to be exhibited in an American circus. For nineteen years, until his death in 1854, he is known to have earned his livelihood through displaying his marked body and performing the Irish jig that had so enthralled his Pacific hosts.[79](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-79) It appears that some former beachcombers, therefore, deliberately exploited the 'otherness' that they represented in their home communities. Through performative displays, the tattoos that had been customary marks of belonging in the Pacific context were deliberately transformed into spectacular symbols of exotic ornamentation within a new social context.

The problematic position of those who had become tattooed in the Pacific Islands was not consigned solely to beachcombers. John Ledyard, who accompanied Cook on his third voyage in the 1770s and was tattooed in Tahiti, described the differing receptions he received during his travels subsequent to his trip to the Pacific, exposing the shifting and unanchored meaning of tattooing in different metropolitan cultural contexts during a period when the practice was still relatively unfamiliar to most Europeans. While visiting France, where round-the-world voyaging was well known, Ledyard described how when 'The Otaheite marks on my hand were discovered; the mistress and the maid asked our servants the history of so strange a sight? They were answered that I was a gentleman who had been round the world. It was enough.'[80](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-80) On this occasion, Ledyard's presentation of himself as a man of status bearing souvenirs of his travels was accepted. His later reception in Russia, where such voyages were still unfamiliar, was somewhat different, however: 'I am a curiosity here . . . Unfortunately, the marks on my hands procure me and my countrymen the appellation of wildmen.'[81](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-81) Here, Ledyard was no longer in control of the 'reading' of his body and status, since observers in a different cultural context perceived his tattoo marks as synonymous with barbarism. Ledyard's experiences reveal how the tattooing process was not only intrinsically linked to the social environment in which an individual became tattooed but that what was accomplished could only be understood in relation to the social environment in which such body modification was perceived. In contexts where tattooing was not a recognized, conventional practice, its meanings were unstable and were transformed as the body moved through time and space.[82](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-82)

The differing engagement of Europeans with the indigenous tattooing practices they encountered in the Pacific reflect both the variety of cross-cultural exchanges that took place during the classic period of voyaging and the different legacies of encounters in the Pacific. For many beachcombers, becoming tattooed in indigenous fashion was a fundamental outcome of their residence in Pacific communities, a product of the social relationships that were established, or which individuals attempted to forge in order to become assimilated. The permanent markers that ensued from these relationships became a source of spectacle in non-Pacific contexts. In the case of more transient, visiting sailors, cross-cultural encounters in the Pacific exposed them to the potential for tattooing to express their own individual and collective relationships and new expertise to facilitate this expression. Seafarers rapidly established ownership over this practice, which became a symbol of their trade. These varied outcomes of exposure to Pacific tattooing are both likely to have contributed to modern understanding of and engagement in the practice in Western societies.# CHAPTER SEVEN

## The Art of the Bodily Surface:  
Contemporary Tattooing in Oceania

Nicholas Thomas

In the summer of 1996, I visited a tattoo studio in Papeete, the capital of Tahiti. The studio was in a converted house in a residential area, up a narrow path beside a high wall. Inside, there were half a dozen young men working on clients. The designs they were applying were mostly conventional Polynesian motifs – turtles, sharks’ teeth, outrigger canoes, etc. – in black or dark blue. Some clients had come in with sketch designs they had found in books or magazines; others were getting designs that the tattooists had drawn up for them. All the young men had themselves been tattooed in the same style, and they were very keen to discuss their work, showing me albums of their own designs and those of others. The studio was a small business, plainly but adequately equipped, and it was clearly a place where young men liked to hang out. The walls were covered with photographs of muscular, tattooed bodies, many of them from the 1960s and ’70s, when bodybuilding and body-marking were popular among the jeunesse dorée of Papeete. As I leafed through the albums, one of the tattooists said, ‘We’re trying to bring back the old _tatau_ tradition. We’re proud of our culture.’ This was not, of course, the old _tatau_ tradition, but a contemporary version of it, influenced by the tattoo cultures of California and elsewhere. Yet it was clear that the young men felt that their work was in some sense authentically Tahitian, that it expressed or enacted their cultural identity.

The studio I visited was one of several in Papeete, and there were others in the other islands of French Polynesia. Most of them were run by young men who had been tattooed themselves and who were enthusiastic about what they saw as a Polynesian tradition. Some of them had been trained by visiting tattooists from California or New Zealand; others had taught themselves from books and magazines. Many of them had also been to Samoa to be tattooed by Sulu’ape Paulo or his son, as had several of their clients. The tattooists in Papeete were part of a broader Pacific tattoo culture, connected through migration, tourism and the circulation of images and ideas. They were also part of a global tattoo culture, connected through the internet, magazines and the movement of tattooists themselves. Their work was hybrid, combining elements from different traditions, but they were clear that they saw themselves as participating in a specifically Polynesian form of tattooing.

This is one of many contemporary tattoo studios in Oceania. Others are in Auckland, Sydney, Honolulu, and elsewhere. Many of them are run by Pacific Islanders, but others are run by non-Pacific tattooists who specialize in Pacific designs. The clientele is mixed, including Pacific Islanders, Europeans, Americans and others. The designs are also mixed, combining traditional Pacific motifs with contemporary elements. Some tattooists are very traditionalist, insisting on the use of hand-tapping methods and traditional designs. Others are more eclectic, using electric tattoo machines and combining Pacific motifs with designs from other cultures. Some are very commercial, producing standardized designs for a mass market. Others are more artistic, producing unique designs for individual clients. What is clear is that tattooing in Oceania today is a vibrant and diverse practice, with multiple meanings and values.

Tattooing has become a significant part of contemporary Pacific culture, both as a marker of cultural identity and as a form of artistic expression. It has also become a significant part of the global tattoo culture, with Pacific designs being popular among tattooists and clients worldwide. This popularity has led to debates about cultural appropriation and authenticity, debates that are part of a broader discussion about the relationship between tradition and modernity in the Pacific. These debates are not new; they have been part of Pacific cultural life since the early days of European contact. What is new is the scale and intensity of these debates, and the ways in which they are played out in a global context.

In this chapter, I want to explore some of these contemporary debates, using examples from tattoo studios in Tahiti, Samoa and New Zealand. I want to look at how tattooists and clients understand their practice, and how this understanding relates to broader questions about Pacific identity and culture. I also want to look at how Pacific tattooing relates to global tattoo culture, and how this relationship is understood and negotiated by Pacific tattooists and their clients. Finally, I want to consider how tattooing in Oceania today relates to the historical practices discussed in earlier chapters of this book, and what this tells us about the nature of cultural continuity and change in the Pacific.

### TRADITION AND MODERNITY

The relationship between tradition and modernity is a central concern in contemporary Pacific tattooing. Many tattooists and clients see their practice as a way of maintaining or reviving traditional Pacific culture. Others see it as a modern practice that has no necessary connection to tradition. Some see it as a hybrid practice that combines traditional and modern elements. These different views reflect different understandings of what tradition is, and what its role should be in contemporary Pacific life.

For many tattooists and clients, tradition is understood as a fixed and authentic set of cultural practices that were disrupted by colonialism and are now being revived. This view is particularly strong in Tahiti, where tattooing was suppressed by Christian missionaries in the nineteenth century and has only recently been revived. The tattooists I spoke to in Papeete were clear that they were reviving an authentic Tahitian tradition, and that their work was part of a broader cultural renaissance. They were proud of their cultural identity and saw tattooing as a way of expressing and maintaining it. They were also aware that their practice was different from the traditional _tatau_ described in historical accounts, but they felt that it was nonetheless authentically Tahitian.

This view of tradition as fixed and authentic is problematic, however. It assumes that there is a pure and unchanging cultural essence that can be recovered or revived, and that contemporary practices can be judged as authentic or inauthentic according to how closely they resemble this essence. This assumption is questionable, both historically and anthropologically. Cultures are not fixed essences but dynamic processes, constantly changing and adapting. Traditional practices are not static but evolve over time, influenced by internal developments and external contacts. The _tatau_ of eighteenth-century Tahiti was different from that of pre-contact Tahiti, and was influenced by European contact. The contemporary tattooing of Tahiti is different again, influenced by global tattoo culture as well as traditional _tatau_.

These changes do not necessarily make contemporary practices inauthentic. They may make them different from earlier practices, but this difference is part of the dynamic nature of culture. The question is not whether contemporary Pacific tattooing is authentic, but how it relates to historical practices and how it is understood by those who practice and receive it. For many tattooists and clients, the relationship is one of continuity rather than rupture. They see their practice as part of an ongoing cultural tradition, even if it has changed over time. They feel that it expresses their cultural identity and connects them to their ancestors. This feeling is real and important, even if it is based on a selective or reconstructed view of tradition.

For others, however, the relationship between contemporary and traditional tattooing is more problematic. Some tattooists and clients are concerned about cultural appropriation, about the use of Pacific designs by non-Pacific people. This concern reflects a broader anxiety about the commodification of Pacific culture and the loss of Pacific control over cultural representations. It also reflects a concern about authenticity, about the difference between Pacific and non-Pacific understandings of tattooing.

These concerns are not unfounded. The popularity of Pacific tattoo designs among non-Pacific people has led to their commercialization and standardization. Many tattoo studios outside the Pacific offer ‘Polynesian’ designs that are based on a superficial understanding of Pacific culture. These designs may be aesthetically pleasing but they lack cultural depth and meaning. They may also perpetuate stereotypes about Pacific people and culture. Some Pacific tattooists are concerned about this and insist on the cultural authenticity of their work. They may refuse to tattoo non-Pacific people, or they may educate their clients about the cultural meaning of their designs.

These concerns about cultural appropriation and authenticity are part of a broader discussion about the relationship between Pacific and global culture. This discussion has many dimensions, including questions about tourism, commodification, representation and identity. Tattooing is just one element in this discussion, but it is an important one because it involves the bodily surface, a fundamental aspect of cultural identity. The way tattooing is practiced and understood in Oceania today reflects the broader tensions and negotiations between tradition and modernity, between local and global, between Pacific and non-Pacific.

### THE BODILY SURFACE

The bodily surface is a key site in contemporary Pacific tattooing. It is the canvas on which cultural identity is inscribed, the medium through which personal and collective meanings are expressed. The surface of the skin is not just a physical boundary but a cultural one, marking the distinction between self and other, between Pacific and non-Pacific, between traditional and modern. Tattooing transforms this surface, making it a site of cultural production and reproduction.

This transformation is not just aesthetic but social and political. Tattooed bodies are not neutral but charged with meaning, with messages about identity, status, affiliation and resistance. In contemporary Pacific societies, tattooed bodies may signal cultural pride, political commitment, social belonging or personal style. They may also signal difference, marginality or opposition. The meaning of tattooed bodies is not fixed but depends on context, audience and interpretation. It is negotiated and contested, part of the ongoing process of cultural and social definition.

The negotiation of meaning is particularly complex in the case of Pacific tattooing because it involves multiple audiences and contexts. Pacific tattooed bodies may be read by other Pacific people, by Europeans or Americans, by tourists or residents, by traditionalists or modernists. Each of these audiences may interpret the tattoos differently, according to their own cultural assumptions and interests. Pacific people may see them as expressions of cultural identity; Europeans or Americans may see them as exotic or primitive; tourists may see them as souvenirs of their travels; residents may see them as markers of social status; traditionalists may see them as authentic or inauthentic; modernists may see them as innovative or derivative.

These different interpretations reflect the hybrid nature of contemporary Pacific tattooing. It combines elements from different traditions and contexts, producing meanings that are multiple and contested. This hybridity is not a weakness but a strength, reflecting the dynamic and adaptive nature of Pacific culture. It allows Pacific people to negotiate their identity in a global context, to maintain connections with their cultural traditions while adapting to contemporary realities. It also allows non-Pacific people to engage with Pacific culture, to learn about it and appreciate it, even if their engagement is limited or superficial.

The bodily surface in contemporary Pacific tattooing is thus a site of cultural negotiation and contestation. It reflects the broader processes of cultural change and adaptation in the Pacific, the ways in which Pacific people are defining their identity in a global world. It also reflects the ongoing importance of the body in Pacific culture, the ways in which bodily practices continue to be central to cultural and social life. Tattooing is not just a decorative practice but a fundamental aspect of Pacific cultural identity, a way of marking the body as a site of cultural meaning.

### CONCLUSION

Contemporary tattooing in Oceania is a vibrant and diverse practice, reflecting the dynamic nature of Pacific culture. It combines traditional and modern elements, local and global influences, producing meanings that are multiple and contested. For many Pacific people, it is a way of expressing and maintaining their cultural identity, of connecting with their ancestors and their traditions. For others, it is a modern practice that has no necessary connection to tradition, or that appropriates and commodifies Pacific culture.

These different understandings reflect broader debates about the relationship between tradition and modernity, between local and global, between Pacific and non-Pacific. They are part of the ongoing process of cultural definition and negotiation in the Pacific, the ways in which Pacific people are adapting to contemporary realities while maintaining connections with their cultural traditions. Tattooing is just one element in this process, but it is an important one because it involves the bodily surface, a fundamental aspect of cultural identity.

The examples discussed in this chapter show that contemporary Pacific tattooing cannot be understood simply as a revival of traditional practice, or as a modern innovation disconnected from tradition. It is a hybrid practice that combines elements from different traditions and contexts, producing new meanings and values. These meanings and values are real and important, even if they are contested or limited. They reflect the ongoing vitality of Pacific culture, its ability to adapt and change while maintaining its fundamental character. They also reflect the global reach of Pacific culture, its influence on tattoo practices worldwide.

In the end, the art of the bodily surface in contemporary Oceania is not just about tattooing but about cultural identity and meaning. It is about the ways in which Pacific people are defining themselves in a global world, and the ways in which their culture is being received and interpreted by others. It is about tradition and modernity, authenticity and appropriation, continuity and change. These are complex and contested issues, but they are central to understanding contemporary Pacific culture and its relationship to the wider world.# CHAPTER TEN

## The Polynesian Body in Transition:  
Tattooing in the Marquesas Islands

Larissa Muller

The Marquesas Islands, located in the north-eastern part of French Polynesia, are one of the most isolated archipelagoes in the world. They are also one of the most culturally conservative island groups in Polynesia. The tattooing traditions of the Marquesas have been well documented by early European explorers and anthropologists, and are still practised today, although in a modified form. This chapter will examine the historical and contemporary practice of tattooing in the Marquesas, and consider how it has been affected by colonialism, Christianity, and globalization.

### HISTORICAL PRACTICE

Tattooing in the Marquesas was first documented by European explorers in the late eighteenth century. Captain James Cook, who visited the islands in 1774, noted that both men and women were heavily tattooed, and that the practice was universal among the islanders. He wrote:

The men and women are tattooed all over the body, the former more especially on the thighs and buttocks, the latter on the hands and arms. The figures are various, consisting of lines, spots, and other devices, which are generally well executed, and have a very pretty effect.[1](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-1)

Cook's observations were echoed by other early visitors, who noted the intricate and extensive nature of Marquesan tattooing. The designs were complex, often covering large areas of the body, and were executed with great skill and precision. The tattooing process was also described as being very painful, and was often accompanied by ritual ceremonies and social celebrations.

The tools used for tattooing in the Marquesas were quite different from those used in other parts of Polynesia. Instead of using a comb-like instrument, Marquesan tattooists used a small chisel made of bone or metal, which was tapped into the skin with a mallet. This technique, known as _tatua_ , produced deep scars and bold designs that were quite distinctive. The pigments used were also unique, consisting of a mixture of soot and oil, which was applied to the wounds created by the chisel.

Tattooing in the Marquesas was not merely decorative, but had deep social and spiritual significance. It was a marker of identity, status, and maturity, and was closely associated with concepts of mana (spiritual power) and tapu (sacredness). The designs themselves often told stories or represented genealogies, and were specific to particular families or social groups. Tattooing was also linked to religious beliefs and practices, and was seen as a way of connecting with the ancestors and the spiritual world.

### COLONIAL IMPACT

The arrival of European missionaries and colonizers in the nineteenth century had a profound impact on Marquesan tattooing. Christianity brought with it a condemnation of the practice, which was seen as barbaric and heathen. The tattooing tools were confiscated, and the practice was actively discouraged and suppressed.

The French colonial administration, which took control of the Marquesas in 1842, also played a role in the decline of tattooing. While not as actively opposed to the practice as the missionaries, the colonial authorities did little to support or encourage it. The introduction of Western clothing, which covered the body, also reduced the visibility and social importance of tattooing.

By the early twentieth century, traditional Marquesan tattooing had largely disappeared. The knowledge of the techniques and designs was fading, and only a few elderly people still bore the extensive tattoos of the old style. The practice seemed to be on the verge of extinction, a victim of colonialism and cultural change.

### CONTEMPORARY REVIVAL

Despite this decline, tattooing in the Marquesas has experienced a revival in recent decades. This has been driven by a renewed interest in traditional culture and identity, as well as by the influence of global tattooing trends.

Contemporary Marquesan tattooing is quite different from the historical practice. While the traditional designs and motifs are still used, the techniques have been modified to suit modern tools and practices. Electric tattoo machines have largely replaced the traditional chisels and mallets, making the process faster and less painful. The pigments have also been updated, with modern inks replacing the traditional soot and oil mixtures.

This revival has been supported by efforts to document and preserve traditional designs. Anthropologists and tattoo artists have worked together to collect historical images and descriptions of Marquesan tattoos, and to recreate them using modern methods. This has helped to ensure that the traditional designs are not lost, even if the traditional methods are no longer used.

The contemporary practice of tattooing in the Marquesas is also more inclusive than the historical practice. While traditional tattooing was largely restricted to Marquesan people, contemporary tattooing is open to anyone who is interested in the designs. This includes tourists, expatriates, and people from other parts of French Polynesia and the world.

### GLOBALIZATION AND COMMODIFICATION

The revival of Marquesan tattooing has been closely linked to globalization and the commodification of Polynesian culture. Tattoo designs from the Marquesas are now popular worldwide, and are used by tattoo artists in many different countries. They are also featured in tattoo magazines, books, and websites, and are part of the global tattooing scene.

This globalization has brought both opportunities and challenges for Marquesan tattoo artists and cultural practitioners. On the one hand, it has created new markets for their work and has increased the visibility and recognition of Marquesan culture. On the other hand, it has also led to concerns about cultural appropriation and the loss of traditional meaning and significance.

Some Marquesan tattoo artists have responded to these challenges by emphasizing the cultural and spiritual significance of their work. They insist that their tattoos are not merely decorative, but are deeply connected to Marquesan identity and tradition. They also work to educate their clients about the cultural meaning of the designs, and to ensure that they are respected and understood.

Others have embraced the commercial aspects of the global tattoo market. They see tattooing as a legitimate business and profession, and work to compete in the global marketplace. They may modify their designs to suit client demands, or may focus on technical skill and artistic innovation rather than cultural authenticity.

### CONCLUSION

Tattooing in the Marquesas Islands has undergone significant changes over the past two centuries. From a universal and deeply significant cultural practice, it became nearly extinct under the impact of colonialism and Christianity. Today, it is experiencing a revival, but in a modified form that reflects contemporary realities and global influences.

This transition reflects the broader changes that have occurred in Marquesan society and culture. The islands have moved from a traditional and isolated society to one that is increasingly connected to the global world. This connection has brought both opportunities and challenges, and has required Marquesan people to adapt and change while still maintaining their cultural identity.

The practice of tattooing in the Marquesas today is a hybrid one, combining traditional designs and meanings with modern techniques and global influences. It is a practice that is both local and global, traditional and contemporary, and that reflects the complex and dynamic nature of Marquesan culture in the modern world.# CHAPTER TEN

## Beyond Modern Primitivism

Cyril Siorat

Ever since the needles have entered my skin and the ink has settled, the existential dimension of tattooing has been clear to me. Born in France, I moved to Moorea, in French Polynesia, aged 20. There I became a friend of Chime, a Marquesan tattoo artist. During my first year-long stay, Chime gave me three tattoos of Marquesan design. It was thirteen years, and several tattoos, later that I started to study the practice officially as an anthropologist. It was then that I became fully acquainted with the literature on tattoo milieux and with the academic debate regarding them. One of the main critiques of contemporary neo-tribal tattooing identifies this subculture under the rubric of 'modern primitive', and suggests that its practice reproduces old primitivist ideas. However, many of those involved today in body modification do not identify themselves in these terms and, although it is important to acknowledge that the wider spectrum of contemporary 'tribal' references does, almost inevitably, include neoprimitivist understandings, the milieux at present are too diverse to be reduced to what is, in fact, a reductionist critique. I argue that the 'modern primitive' label has been seized upon by commentators who have not considered how aptly it captures the contemporary practices, personal histories and motivations of the protagonists, and the ways that these have changed since the publication of the now notorious anthology _Modern Primitives_ in 1989.[1](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-1) This chapter attempts to rebut the critique, in particular through a consideration of the commodification of tattoos. I defend the contemporary movement from the charge that it is embedded above all in normative definitions of consumer culture.

Since the publication of _Modern Primitives_ in 1989 by the alternative arts press Re/Search,[2](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-2) there has been some discussion among social scientists regarding the identity and motivations of European and American individuals involved in the body modification movement. One of the main criticisms has been that such movements are involved in the facile idealization of the exotic 'Other'. In consequence, so the argument goes, they perpetuate classic primitivist assumptions. Modern primitives are, according to Klesse, a 'legacy of colonialism in late imperial culture'.[3](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-3) It is easy to feel confused about the identity of 'modern primitives', considering the multiple networks of which the tattoo community is formed. It seems that if there is such a thing as a 'modern primitive' movement, it is likely to be localized, on the west coast of the USA, and within the context of a network evolving around particular individuals such as Fakir Musafar. In London, home to a dynamic body modification community, I am still to find someone who would define her or himself as a 'modern primitive'. I am not suggesting that people in London were not inspired by the _Modern Primitives_ publication, and subsequent work in that field, but that the identity marker 'modern primitive' seems to be almost always assigned by non-body modifier individuals, 'in the know', rather than used as a self-expression of identity.

Rather than being rigid and inflexible, individual and group identities have always been involved in a constant dialectical process involving the other, as both the Polynesian revival and the changing global tattoo community shows. 'Individual identity is located within a two-way social process, an interaction of "ego" and "other", inside and outside. It is in the meeting of internal and external definition that identity, whether collective or individual, is created'.[4](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-4) Therefore, 'identification is never a unilateral process; at the very least there is always an audience'.[5](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-5) In that sense, publications from the 'modern primitive' movement could be regarded as internal definition, while academic work scrutinizing them is an external definition.

I would argue, however, that both should be conceptualized as external to the multiple body modification networks and to the individuals involved in these networks. Different features of these external definitions will coincide or differ from the internal definition of the individuals involved in body modification practices, giving rise either to negative or positive confirmation of the perceived internal identity. Therefore, considering that identification processes are constant, social scientists should be careful not to assign the label 'modern primitive' to any individual involved in body modification and who refers in some way or another to 'tribalism' or to an urge to modify their bodies.

Another aspect of the 'modern primitive' publications and term is that they are ironic. There is an awareness that nobody can be a 'primitive', hence the addition of 'modern' to the term, and that the association of these two terms collapses a popular dichotomy. These publications are important media of self-promotion and self-expression rather than academically sanctioned arguments. Many of the contributors to _Modern Primitives_,[6](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-6) do not refer to themselves as 'modern primitives' but share some sensibilities with some aspects of the agenda of this particular network. Therefore caution should be applied when categorizing such networks, and one should be aware of the danger of objectifying the Other and denouncing such processes in the past while, at the same time, participating in current categorization of 'others'. Furthermore, I do not believe that irony invalidates personal narratives and embodied experiences as scholars such as Turner seem to imply.[7](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-7) If the ironists always hold their views of the world in doubt,[8](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-8) it is because, as Beck argues:

Doubt . . . which not only serves science but now, applied reflexively, disrupts and destroys the latter's false and fragile clarities and pseudo-certainties, could become the standard for a new modernity which starts from the principles of precaution and reversibility. Contrary to a widespread mistake, doubt makes everything – science, knowledge, criticism and morality – possible once again, only different, a couple of sizes smaller, more tentative, personal, colourful and open to social learning. Hence it is also more curious, more open to things that are contrary, unsuspected and incompatible, and all this with the tolerance that is based in the ultimate final certainty of error.[9](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-9)

The term 'modern primitive' was coined by an individual called Fakir Musafar in the late 1970s to describe himself and a few other people who were following a similar personal path. Born in 1930, Fakir Musafar has been a pioneer in the practice of body modification, such as piercing and branding, and has been involved in modifying his body for the last 50 years. Now called 'the father of modern primitivism', Fakir Musafar spent a great time experimenting in secret. 'Unfortunately, I was driven into deep isolation and shame . . . for lack of any social sanction . . . I knew that if I let it be known what I felt and what I was doing, I would probably have been institutionalised'.[10](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-10) This led him to find, in past and present painful rituals from around the world, some form of sanction. He found social sanction in the fact that body modification behaviours were deemed acceptable, and often desirable, in diverse human cultures. In a way, this yearning for social sanction of types of behaviour considered too deviant in mainstream Western society could be interpreted as a plea for inclusion rather than exclusion. Body modification, then, could be seen not as a rebellious act but a confirmation of one's alterity. This is also a form of resistance but not a conflictual one.

Resistance has often been understood as a binary opposite of domination. However, if power is dispersed, multiple and relational, as Foucault argues, then resistance must also be diffuse, decentred – an integral part of power rather than its opposite. As Rosenblatt points out, resistance does not mean activities that 'escape existing systems of meaning';[11](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-11) acts are inevitably formed in relation to the society from whence they come. He argues that so-called 'modern primitives' position themselves in a conflictual opposition to capitalist consumption and Christianity when in fact their beliefs reflect certain Christian ideas about the relationship of the individual self to society.[12](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-12) I would disagree with Rosenblatt's assertion that modern primitives' own view is necessarily simplistically conflictual; it can also be seen as a plea for an inclusion of alterity within mainstream society.

This plea could also be perceived as a demand, a demand that the boundaries of what is civilized and what is primitive be collapsed into an ironic, contrary and problematic statement. Nonetheless, it is true that the discourse of Fakir Musafar reifies some popular Western primitive conceptions that are grounded in colonial discourse and gaze, as Klesse argues.[13](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-13) It is also true that a lot of tattoo artists and tattooed individuals do have fairly naïve and simplistic ideas about what tribal tattoos represent and what a Euro-American person becomes by taking them on. In that sense, Rosenblatt is right to argue that most references to primitive in the West have more to do with a perceived lost social sense of the self, of Euro-American individuals, than with any non-Western cultures.[14](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-14) It is, however, also important to note that the Western concept of the primitive has sometimes been taken as an identity marker by colonized population themselves. Furthermore, the tattoo and body modification milieu is heterogeneous. There seems to be a gulf between an individual who is getting a pseudo tribal tattoo in Europe, in the absence of much knowledge of its origins and meanings, and who probably holds a fairly naïve set of New Age motivations, and the smaller network of people who are more actively part of a genuinely cross-cultural community, and who are engaged in something different from consumerist appropriation.

In California in the early 1970s Fakir Musafar went public and gave a performance of ritual piercing in a tattoo convention. From then on, his experimentation with body modification influenced and inspired different sub-cultural networks, sado-masochism (S&M) and punk, for example. That Musafar chose to give his first public performance at an event organized by the tattoo community is indicative of the strength of the tattooing networks at that time. From the 1960s onwards, as Benson argues, the tattoo community went through great changes 'increasing international communication, technical innovation and the work of a number of key individuals, many from art school backgrounds, radically transformed the possibilities of the medium'.[15](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-15) Through the 1980s an increasing interest developed among some tattoo artists for traditional tattoo designs from places where a tattoo tradition had been, or was still part of the cultural array of symbolic expressions. By the late 1980s the work of the Filipino-American tattoo artist Leo Zulueta, among a few others, became an inspiration worldwide in the development of such styles, and although he appears in the publication _Modern Primitives_, he does not refer to himself as one.[16](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-16) His work does not entail an underlying desire to be the 'Other'. Rather, he equates his research into traditional designs as conservation of an aesthetic tradition: 'all the old men having "primitive"-style tattoos are dead. . . . The last man to have a back piece like mine, who was over ninety years old, passed away a couple of years ago. This is why I really feel strongly about preserving those ancient designs'.[17](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-17) He also acknowledges the possibility that the 'original' meanings of these designs may never be understood in the contemporary setting. His work does not, however, entail a conservation of the designs in the butterfly collector's manner. They are preserved on their original medium, the human skin. It would also seem that for some tattooists, at least, the search is not for a mythical primitive 'Other' but for themselves. Leo Zulueta, for example, is half Filipino and grew up in Hawaii, suggesting perhaps that the inner motivations of body modifiers are complex, varied, and often rooted in personal cross-cultural biographies rather than mono-dimensional ones.

While the 'neo-tribal /black work' tattoo styles were developing momentum in North America and Europe, other tattoo communities were also involved in major evolutions. Tattooing was a prominent procedure throughout Polynesia, before its colonization. In French Polynesia, for example, Christian missions and the colonial authorities stopped the practice of tattooing for more than a century. Since the late 1970s, however, tattooing has been revived by Ma'ohi (native Polynesian) cultural agents (traditional dance troupes and other artists). It is now highly visible and a growing aspect of the local tourist industry. The traditional Tahitian and Marquesan designs that are tattooed today in French Polynesia are also important cultural and social identity markers (see Kuwahara, this volume).

During the last fifteen years, Ma'ohi tattoo artists have themselves been influenced and inspired by different cultural tattoo designs and styles, including Samoan and also North American and European 'black work'. Polynesian tattooists also became regular guests at tattoo conventions in North America and Europe. They forged strong relationships and created global networks with 'tribal' practitioners. A great influence throughout the 1990s was that of the late Paulo Sulu'ape from Western Samoa, where there has been a continuity of practice throughout the colonial and post-colonial periods (see Mallon, this volume). Sulu'ape introduced many tattooists to traditional methods of tattooing and inspired many others by communicating the meanings and context of the Samoan designs he tattooed in many non-Samoan skins. In Tahiti, however, it is paradoxical that the forms and meanings of contemporary Ma'ohi tattoos are reconstructed from representations produced by explorers and colonial agents in the nineteenth century. In my view, 'authentic' Ma'ohi tattooists are therefore involved in a similar process of recontextualizing symbols as are the 'inauthentic' so-called modern primitives.

## TATTOOS AND COMMODIFICATION

At this point, I would like to explore the involvement of tattoos in consumer culture since it is often used as a challenge to their authenticity. Through this discussion, I intend to develop further some of the points raised in this introductory section. It has been argued that tattoos, and body modifications in general, 'do not escape commodification',[18](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-18) that they 'can be purchased for money like other commodities'[19](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-19) and should 'be interpreted in the context of an increasingly trendy aestheticization and commodification of ethnic difference'.[20](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-20) On the other hand, it has also been argued that body modifications 'differ from other "free-floating" commodities, not only because of their status as permanent or "semi-permanent" modifications to the body, but also because of the necessary physicality of their production'[21](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-21) and the pain that accompanies such practices.[22](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-22) The permanent aspect of tattoos render them 'the ultimate' in anti-fashion.[23](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-23) In other words, there are two views regarding tattoos and commodity. The first is that tattoos have been commoditized. Anyone can walk into a tattoo shop, choose a design, pay and come out with a new tattoo. The socio-cultural context of the design is irrelevant; it could be argued that the tattoo as a product is alienated. The second perspective considers tattoos to be potent anti-commodity symbols due to their non-exchangeability, their permanence and their personal nature. Although divergent, these two views do not contradict each other since they both focus on different times in the biography of a tattoo. There is a popular belief in Western culture that things are either commodities or are not. At one pole are things that 'represent the natural universe of commodities' and 'at the opposite pole we place people, who represent the natural universe of individuation and singularization'.[24](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-24) However, this is a relatively recent dichotomy.

Works by Appadurai[25](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-25) and Thomas[26](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-26) emphasize, in their respective definitions of commodities, the importance of context. Appadurai suggests that 'commodity . . . refers to things that, at a certain _phase_ in their careers and in a particular _context_ , meet the requirements of commodity candidacy'.[27](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-27) The commodity candidacy here is understood to mean 'the standards and criteria that define the exchangeability of things in any particular social and historical context'.[28](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-28) Anything, therefore, can become a commodity in the time of its existence as long as it meets the candidacy requirements of its context. When things do not meet the commodity candidacy, they become singular and have reached a different phase in their status. Thomas presents commodities 'as objects, persons, or elements of persons, which are placed in a context in which they have exchange value and can be alienated. The alienation of a thing is its dissociation from producers, former users, or prior context'.[29](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-29) The alienability of things or persons is crucial to their status as commodities. If such dissociation cannot be attained, objects may become 'artefacts which tell a story'.[30](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-30) Furthermore Kopytoff's definition of commodities emphasizes the importance of the discrete nature of the exchange. This is 'in order to stress that the primary and immediate purpose of the transaction is to obtain the counterpart value'.[31](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-31) This is in contrast to gift exchanges where rules of relations of reciprocity should apply. At this point, however, it should be made clear that commodity exchange is not a feature of modern societies and gift exchange a feature of traditional societies. Both systems seem to exist, to varying degrees of popularity, in all human societies. The root of the commodity seems to lie in the action of exchange. Exchange, being at the root of human social life and a universal feature of it, makes commodities a universal aspect of culture.[32](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-32) The commodity status is therefore a flexible one; a phase in a biography, and commoditization a 'process of becoming'.[33](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-33) The commodity must be alienable from its origins and its exchange does not entail any further obligations or expectations. Moreover, there seems to be a constant conflictual relationship between the drive to extend the arena of commodity exchange, and widen the range of available commodity items, and a human need for the singularization of particular items or range of items. The former is inherent to the exchange technology, while the latter is motivated by individuality and culture.[34](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-34)

The rise, in the nineteenth century, of new exchange technologies[35](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-35) and of a materialist culture and new types of consumption, avid of products from all over the world,[36](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-36) was instrumental to a rapid expansion of the process of commoditization and, in turn, to the capitalist system. Appadurai,[37](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-37) quoting the work of Sombart, links this new type of consumption to the demands of the bourgeois and nobility classes for luxury goods. Luxuries should not be regarded as the opposite of necessities but rather as 'goods whose principal use is rhetorical and social, goods that are simply incarnated signs'.[38](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-38) Luxuries are part of a particular register of consumption rather than a special class of things.[39](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-39) Similarly, I would propose that tattoos are also part of a particular register of consumption. I do not want to argue that tattoos are luxury items reserved for the elites, but rather that they represent incarnated signs for marginal communities; a luxurious symbol of otherness.

There are five main attributes that should be displayed by incarnated signs as commodities. These are restriction to elites, complexity of acquisition, semiotic virtuosity, regulation by fashion, and 'a high degree of linkage of their consumption to body, person, and personality'.[40](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-40) While tattoos would not have to display all of these attributes to qualify as an incarnated sign involved in a particular register of consumption, I would argue that they do. Take, for example, the criterion of restriction to elites: although it is clear that they are not restricted to an elite _per se_, until recently their access was restricted to certain groups of people. Today, even if the restriction seems have been removed to an extent, tattoos still have a certain degree of difficulty of access. To start with, tattoo artists' rates are not cheap. Another restriction can be the painful nature of the tattooing process, which may not appeal to all. And finally the prospective tattooee may consider the social restrictions imposed on future social interactions based on pre-conceptions of tattoos – for example, difficulty in finding employment. When the production technology of incarnated signs becomes more advanced and able to produce these articles in increased numbers and at a lower price, they become more accessible to anyone and therefore lose their restriction attribute.[41](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-41) This shift, from different spheres of exchange value, seems to manifest itself as a shift from issues of exclusivity to issues of authenticity.[42](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-42) I would like to propose that a similar shift has happened in the tattoo world.

Up to three decades ago, tattoos were mainly acquired by marginal groups. These were, in the West, soldiers, sailors, criminals and people involved in body modification, such as tattoo artists themselves. Most incarnated signs symbolized belonging to particular groups and/or the partaking of particular activities, for example, military regiments, port of calls, time in jail and allegiance to a pimp. Tattoos were the quasi-exclusivity of these groups. However, in the last fifteen years, tattoos have become part of popular culture. They are used in advertising campaigns to portray, among other things, sexual attractiveness. There has been an invasion, of the high streets in the West, of roses, dolphins, yin & yang, and other small tattoos. I would argue that the exclusivity of tattoos was threatened by a shift towards a perceived common, or more mainstream, sphere of exchange value. The shift from different spheres of exchange value moved, similarly to the one mentioned above, from issues of exclusivity to issues of authenticity, or rather here of authenticities. The first authenticity I am referring to has to do with authenticity of commitment. It could be argued that as small tattoos became more popular, people involved in the body modification movement had to engage more extensively with these embodied incarnated signs. Bigger tattoos and body-suits, as well as extensive piercings, became a way to authenticate this commitment, one sign of this exclusivity being tattoos that cannot be hidden by clothes. The second authenticity has to do with the origin and process of tattooing itself.

As I noted earlier, an important aspect of the tattoo revival is the tribal and traditional styles and the tattoo artists involved in this style. Designs used as tattoos can be found worldwide and, in the late 1970s and '80s, some Western tattoo artists started to use some of these designs as inspirations (for the longevity of this process of exchange and innovation, see Mallon, this volume). However, the cultural context of such design was mainly unrelated to its use in tattoo shops; the designs were alienated and therefore commoditized. However, some individuals involved in this revival wanted artefacts, designs that told stories, rather than alienated commodities, and travelled to encounter and engage with the places of origin of some of these designs. Oceania was one of the instrumental locations of these encounters. Authenticity became a question of context. Context includes here both the place in which, and the person from whom, one will get a tribal or traditional tattoo. Similar designs tattooed in Cardiff by a home-based tattoo artist; in London by a renowned tribal tattoo artist; in Auckland by a Maori tattoo artist; and in Madrid at a tattoo convention by a mixed race Polynesian tattoo artist with traditional tools all have greatly different degrees of authenticity.

It has been argued that 'traditional Maori . . . signs are woven into global consumerism, where they are endlessly modernised, producing a complex hybridisation of signs and messages'.[43](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-43) Rather than equating the presence of Maori tattoos with a destructive modernization, however, the development of the 'neo-tribal', also called 'black work', can be perceived as another period in that style. By this I mean that there can be no exact replicas of something. However rigid and static a ritual, a style or a practice may be to the outside observer, however rooted in tradition they may seem, the enactment will always be a reinterpretation of the past and therefore different from it. There is a change from the use of these designs in their original context, but there is a certain continuity regarding their use as modes of embodied symbolic expressions in varied contexts.

It may be that these abstract designs, rather than the personal statement, attract many people, because the latter can be easily (mis)read. Furthermore, Phillips and Steiner[44](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-44) have argued that a possible way to define it may reside 'in the very process of collection, which inscribes, at the moment of acquisition, the character and qualities that are associated with the object in both individual and collective memories'.[45](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-45) The authenticity of a tattoo similarly may reside in that moment when, inscribed in the body, it acquires the character and qualities of the individual, and collective perceptions of the context from which it arose. In that sense, tattoos can be read adequately only through the context of their creation and the discourse used to convey the personal narrative attached to them, but this context does not rely on some originary, 'tribal' or traditional source. Furthermore, I agree with Sullivan's conclusion[46](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-46) that

bodily inscription is not so much a writing with or on the body (both of which assume a body-subject that pre-exists writing), but rather it is an infinite (re)writing and (re)reading of the body-subject in and through its relations with carnal sensuosity of the Other and the world, and with culturally and historically specific social fictions.[47](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-47)

It could therefore be argued that tattoos are in fact constant changing processes that can be 'read' synchronically.

The absence of reciprocity relations, inherent in the discrete nature of commodity exchange, does not mean that such exchanges will be non-personal encounters. For example, as Thomas explains,[48](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-48) in New Georgia ritual knowledge, and to an extent ritual agency, can be 'purchased' from specialists. The names of these specialists are important to the purchasers and it could be assumed that there was an ongoing particular relationship between the two. However, although 'the practice of ritual may often have involved reference to the source of knowledge, to the empowering authority, . . . in such contexts the allusion to the name figures as authentication and validation, rather than as the expression of longer-term indebtedness'.[49](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-49) This is similar to the way that some tattoos gain authenticity. The name of the tattoo artist is important but does not imply that there is any relationship beyond the particular time spent acquiring the tattoo. The nature of the exchange can vary, however, according to context. There are a number of differences in the nature of the exchange depending on the identities of prospective tattooed individuals and their relationship with the tattoo artist. The price of a tattoo is usually a negotiation, and may or may not involve money. Furthermore, tattoo artists' rates do not seem to be influenced greatly by market forces. Thus it could also be possible that tattooing exchanges are sometimes more akin to Firth's 'exchange by private treaty', a situation in which something like price is arrived at by some negotiated process other than the impersonal forces of supply and demand.[50](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-50) Therefore, it seems that the nature of the exchange of tattoos can vary, depending on context and individual perceptions, from commodity exchange to gift exchange via exchange by private treaty.

Individual perceptions of the nature of the exchange have a great influence, I believe, on determining the status of a tattoo in the commodity spheres. When the prospective tattooed individual chooses a template design and does not engage in any further exchange relations with the tattoo artist, except by name for authentication purposes, the tattoo can be perceived as commoditized. According to this view, a tattoo is a commodity at the time of its exchange and becomes a singularized symbol once decommoditized. The fact that it cannot be exchanged could also classify it as a terminal commodity; that is, not intended for further exchange.[51](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-51) However, one of the interesting aspects of the exchange of tattooing is that, most of the time, it is not directly the tattoo that is valued, but rather the time of the tattoo artist. It could be argued that what is bought is the skill and expertise of the artist and that therefore it is these that are commoditized rather than the tattoo itself. Furthermore, in a sense, the tattoo as an object does not exist until after the exchange: until it is finished. Up to that point it is only the Platonic form of a tattoo. Once finished, it will become a singular entity and therefore will move out of the commodity phase of its biography. In other words, the tattoo is only a commodity during its own process of becoming a singular entity – prior to its birth. Nonetheless, many people will use the financial cost of a tattoo as one of its defining markers. There seems to be no doubt that exclusivity is symbolized through financial restriction. This view, in a sense, assigns to the singular tattoo an identity marker normally associated with commodities, price being a primary symbol of a discrete transaction. Thus, my point is that a tattoo is never really commoditized. On the one hand, it is the skill and time of the tattoo artists that are commoditized, not the tattoo itself. And on the other hand, it is sometimes given the identity of a commodity, as a symbol of exclusivity on financial grounds, when it has already become a singular entity.

Complex societies are prone to yearn for singularization.[52](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-52) It is interesting to note that the rise in popularity of tattoos, and of body modifications in general, coincides with different expansions of the spheres of values and increased momentum towards wider commoditization/commodification. It seems difficult to decide if this is mainly due to a shift in the practice of tattooing towards a different sphere of value or if it emanates from an attraction towards a symbol of embodied singularization. The Western perspective that polarizes people and things, the singular and the commodity, considers the human body to be the most singularized entity. Tattoos will therefore assume a particular place in that polarity. Furthermore, 'power often asserts itself symbolically precisely by insisting on its right to singularize an object, or a set or class of objects'.[53](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-53) Therefore, individuals can symbolically assert their power by their attempts to singularize objects. Thus, tattoos could be perceived as a relevant medium for such symbolic expressions. Nonetheless, there seems to be a paradox in the sense that, however singularized the personal information contained in a tattoo may be, the mainstream use of this particular media will tend to pull it away from its regime of consumption, and lessen its potency as a symbol of embodied singularization.

My analysis therefore leads me towards a view that tattoos themselves are not commodities. However, a phase of their biographies is commoditized; that is, in the process of becoming. What seems therefore to be engaged in the battle between commoditization and singularization is the nature of the exchange; in a sense tattooing rather than tattoos. Depending on the context and on the protagonists involved, and their respective perceptions of the nature of the exchange, tattooing could be classified either as commodity exchange, gift exchange or exchange by private treaty. This flexibility seems to enable the tattoo communities to deal with the popularity of the practice, and offers an array of possible relationships to choose from during complex encounters with a wide range of individuals. This is why, I feel, it is futile to describe 'traditional' tattoos as expressions of 'thick/hot' social relationships, and contemporary tattoos as only able to create, and stem from, 'thin/cold' ones.[54](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-54)

Furthermore, tattoos, and body modifications in general, demand a positive engagement with pain and suffering. This, I believe, indicates that a particular type of relationship may be forged through such experiences. This is because the 'particularly un-negotiable sensation which is pain when involved in ritual, 'acts to embed . . . a connection within a larger network of interpersonal ties . . . a network of relationships'.[55](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-55) These webs of relationships involve multi-dimensional connections among people, places and the social, cultural and historical narratives attached to them, and evolve within the symbolic, aesthetic and political spheres at play in the human condition.

In the Euro-American world, body modification is considered a matter of choice, but body modifications are only optional, in fact, as long as one does not want to belong to a body modification network. Within those networks, they arguably remain a form of initiation ritual.[56](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-56) In this context, however, the transformation of the person has to do less with coming of age and more with an acceptance of personal alterities and a symbol of a 'capacity for intense experience'.[57](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-57) In this, pain is instrumental because its 'social signification . . . is to give a sharper dimension to memory by welding the community through the same references'.[58](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-58) If, further, as Jackson has argued,[59](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-59) the world of constant pain cannot be understood by non-sufferers, because pain 'shatters language',[60](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-60) it could be that these group references exist at the pre-objective level of experience, before it is expressed through language. It can be argued that pain, because it is experienced through the body, can be conceived as an emotion and as such 'contains much that is indeterminate and inchoate, [and so] it is often poorly served by everyday-world language'.[61](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-61) This experience, which can be said to be shared beyond any narratives, could act as a perceived inter-subjectivity across culture and time. This could also account for the 'primal urge' to modify their bodies often cited by body modifiers.

The last point I would like to make is that there is an important aspect of the relationship between pain and tattoos that is clear in the popular adage: 'pain is unavoidable, suffering is optional'. This is a demand not only for the tattooee to engage positively with the painful experience, but also, I believe, a more general demand of a shift of values away from those preached by a form of Protestant humanism that denies the individual its capacity to suffer. Therefore, 'body modification initiates its adepts into a cruel ritual system incommensurable with mainstream religious practice'.[62](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-62) It is, however, crucial to understand that the point is not solely in the pain but also, and in some ways more importantly, in its relief. 'There is a power, innate to all pain, after the relief, an initiatic dimension, a solicitation to live more intensely the consciousness of existence . . . [pain] gives a sense of life's price . . . [and] is a radical principle of metamorphosis'.[63](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-63) This seems to be a recurrent theme raised by my informants. As Stephen, one of them, puts it: 'I feel a lot more alive after each tattoo session. It is almost like a doctor, but not to make you better but to make you feel alive. This is why I get tattooed more and more. It is the sensation of pinching yourself to know if you are awake.' Finally, I would like to suggest that, although some body modifiers' discourse expresses a kind of 'corporeal absolutism',[64](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-64) their tentative assertions of symbolic power over their suffering bodies may have the effect that 'by controlling this violence, by sculpting it with devotion at the heart of the self, [human beings] subordinate their condition rather than submit to it'.[65](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-65)

This article has shown that the ironic term 'modern primitive' cannot be used as a blanket identity marker to describe these global cross-cultural networks. Through the discussion on issues of commodification, I attempted to show the complexity and heterogeneous nature of the global tattooing community. The level to which such networks are involved in consumer culture and society as a whole tend to imply that, at least for some body modifiers, the agenda is inclusion of their alterity rather than simplistic rebellion.

# EPILOGUE

## Embodied Exchanges and their Limits

Nicholas Thomas

In a recent documentary on tattoo, one of the interviewees is a German woman. She enthuses about the topic. She leans close to the camera and says: 'Once you have one tattoo, you will want more.' This is a deceptively simple statement, but one that arguably speaks volumes about contemporary Euro-American tattooing. It tells us, specifically, what motivates and requires tattooing, and what ontological register tattoos occupy. People get tattoos, in this conception, because they have an individual desire or appetite for them. They are things that you 'want'. They are also things that can exist in a series. One gets one, then another, and then another.

It is obvious that a tattoo such as the _pe'a_ is not generally obtained because it is merely wanted. It, like many other Polynesian body modifications, is obtained because it or they are cosmologically or socially required (if nevertheless also desired), in one specific sense or another. And it will also be apparent that although the _pe'a_ is made up of distinct components, it consists neither of a series of those components nor as an element in a series itself. It is a unity and a totality, not a form susceptible to numeration. The same may be said of the _malu_, even though the woman's form may appear, superficially, to be composed out of a set of discrete elements.

Hence, if a Euro-American subject obtains a _pe'a_ or _malu_ among other tattoos, he or she arguably draws that form away from its cultural predicates. This drawing away, abstraction from, or appropriation, is in any case present in the fact that the Euro-American subject approaches either the male or female Samoan tattoo, not as something socially required, but as one among a range of 'tattoos', one among a possible repertoire of 'neo-tribal' and other tattoos that may be available for a desiring subject's acquisition. Just _how_ available a Samoan tattoo may be to a non-Samoan man or woman is another matter. To acknowledge that _pe'a_ and _malu_ are not simply there for the taking from tattoo studios – but have been taken on, rather, by non-Samoans who, like Fomison, occupy certain relationships with Samoans, already complicates a line of argument that might be developed, on the basis of the juxtaposition I have made, between the cultural underpinnings of Samoan and Euro-American tattoos.

That juxtaposition is consistent with a classical, culturally relativist anthropology that would locate _tatau_ and tattoo within different cultural orders. It is moreover consistent with some (but not all) indigenous Polynesian understandings, which situate Samoan _tatau_ or Maori _ta moko_ in domains that are integrated and distinct. The model that underlies these understandings of difference is, of course, that of language: it is self-evident that Samoan and Maori are different from each other and different from English, and we can see the negotiation between them as a matter of inherently imperfect translation. This way of understanding cultural variety is both implicitly persuasive and manifestly problematic. Language itself is the most compelling of metaphors, and at one level nothing seems more natural than modelling cultural upon linguistic difference. This is not the place to rehearse either the valid aspects or the many real pitfalls of these assumptions in general. The point can merely be made that the case of tattooing – or rather that of _tatau_/tattoo – sits uneasily within these terms. A Euro-American person does not bear a 'translation' of the _pe'a_ but the _pe'a_ itself, yet a _pe'a_ that has been at least partially, and perhaps very profoundly recontextualized.

The examples reviewed in this book suggest that it is vital to position cultural forms in terms different to those presumed by the longstanding debates around cultural relativism. Relativism was always explicitly or implicitly opposed to universalism, whereby sexual mores, psychological attitudes or art symbols were always from one perspective locally distinctive valuations, or from the other the effects of structural, cognitive or biological constants. The materials considered here are cross-cultural from the start, which is to say neither culturally unique nor universal. Each Polynesian _tatau_ tradition represented a particular transformation of others. Each modern _tatau_ and tattoo practice drew upon, differentiated itself from, and sustained or forgot antecedent practices. These transformations were possible and are possible because tattoo practices and tattoos have possessed cross-cultural efficacy and salience as well as culturally specific meaning. That cross-cultural efficacy has entailed the potential for their interested recognition and misrecognition, the possibility that they may be adopted or appropriated rather than ignored.

The cases considered in this book, moreover, also displace the comparative operation from theory to history. Those interested in cross-cultural analysis have, as it were, been beaten to the game by Rutherford and Sulu'ape as well as many before, between and since. Those actors, who applied or assumed cross-cultural tattoos, engaged in translation, or rather transposition and recontextualization. They pre-empted the question of whether and how _tatau_ could be taken from one cultural milieu into another – by simply doing it.

If we recognize that _tatau_ was even, in its varied pre-colonial Polynesian expressions, always already a cross-cultural, historically shaped adaptation, that does not alter the point that, within specific societies, it assumed particular values and meanings – meanings that may indeed be as coherent and distinctive as the Tahitian, Samoan and Maori languages. To acknowledge this would seem only to take us back to the point that I have made and retreated from – that the Samoan tattoo specifically has a singular motivation and logic, even an ontology, which the tattoo form itself can be abstracted from, but which is not susceptible to translation.

It remains important to affirm this point – that different modes of tattooing may be fundamentally distinct in their predicates, in the notions of the person, the body, and society, that underlie them. But, just as languages may diverge, merge or otherwise change, the absoluteness of this distinct integrity may become historically compromised. It is evident that since at least the mid-twentieth century, when Groves produced his drawings, that the classic Samoan _pe'a_ could coexist with other tattoo (not _tatau_) forms. And that has clearly become far more common more recently. This does not mean that the _pe'a_ or _malu_ no longer has its own highly distinctive qualities, but that those qualities cannot be associated with one culture that is located in Samoa, and juxtaposed with another that is located in Europe or America. It is evident rather that both logics may appear, in compromised forms, on the one body. This instance might appear only as one of what anthropologists used to call 'acculturation', otherwise labelled syncretism, creolization or hybridity.

But at this point it needs to be recalled that Samoan _tatau_ is only one among many Polynesian practices. In Tahiti, _tatau_ incorporated both a unitary whole – the standard blacked buttocks and arches – _and_ potentially a series of idiosyncratic elements. In other words, the art form already incorporated distinctive predicates. It is vital that we do not underestimate the complexity and heterogeneity of Pacific art – which cannot be recognized purely as a collectively motivated practice, which may be culturally or ontologically juxtaposed to Western values. If we accept that the form the Western tattoo took – that is, that of the individually desired, individual motif – already existed within the Polynesian tattoo world it is not only our understanding of indigenous tattoo traditions that must change. 'Translation' seems, less than ever, the right term. Nor is it any longer obvious that the Europeans who take on 'neo-tribal' tattoos necessarily perpetrate an invidious distortion of indigenous values. In some cases they certainly do, but in others they may not. The issue can be adjudicated only by talking about which people, when, in the contexts of what cross-cultural dealings. Kabris's case is not the same as Rutherford's, and Rutherford's is not the same as Fomison's. To look at tattooing now – to look at _tatau_/tattoo now – is like looking through a kaleidoscopic device. When you turn the tube, every element of the world changes, to fall into place – or not – in a new way.

This described _tatau_ as follows: 'Both sexes indent or prick the flesh about and below the hips in a multitude of places, with the points of sharp bones, and these indentures they fill with a dark blue or blackish paint, which ever after continues, and discolours the skin in those places, rendering it black. This practice is universal among them, and is called tat-tow, a term which they afterwards applied to letters when they saw us write, being themselves perfectly illiterate' (p. 44).

[2](09_Chapter_03.xhtml#rref3-2) Maori tattooing, though often involving intricate markings on the face and other parts of the body, was never carried out 'from head to foot', for example. See John Rickman, _Journal of Captain Cook's Last Voyage to the Pacific Ocean on Discovery; Performed in the Years 1776, 1777, 1778, 1778_ (London, 1781), pp. 59–60, for a similar version of events.

[6](09_Chapter_03.xhtml#rref3-6) A distinction is made here between voluntary tattooing and tattooing used as a punitive practice which is known to have been employed historically in Britain and other locations at various times. See, for example, Caplan, 'Introduction', p. xvi.

[7](09_Chapter_03.xhtml#rref3-7) 'Mark'd' was one of the contemporary terms used to describe permanent inscriptions on the body prior to the introduction of the word 'tattoo' as a direct consequence of the Cook voyages.

Whether in these latter cases the individuals in question had visited the Pacific or the motif had, by this stage, been incorporated into the lexicon of designs adopted by sailors, cannot be definitively ascertained.

[17](09_Chapter_03.xhtml#rref3-17) Gell, _Wrapping in Images_ , p. 10. In his use of the concept of _habitus_ , Gell explicitly drew on the work of Pierre Bourdieu. See, for example, Bourdieu, _Outline of a Theory of Practice_ (Cambridge, 1977), pp. 72–87.

Mariner appears to have been given relative freedom due to the understanding he had established with those in power concerning his different cultural background. This may explain why there is no evidence that he was tattooed. In contrast, in his Introduction to Mariner's account, the editor, John Martin, described the appearance of Higgins, one of Mariner's crewmates: 'He is beautifully tattowed from the hips nearly to the knees, agreeably to the custom of the Tonga people. Upon them it appears of a black colour, but upon a white man it causes the skin to resemble soft blue satin. The neatness, and I might also say, the mathematical precision with which the pattern is executed, far surpasses the expectation of all who see it for the first time' (p. xii).

Based on his fieldwork in the 1920s, Te Rangi Hiroa (Peter Buck) pointed out that as well as being less elaborate and involving less ceremony, 'the tattooing of a girl is often used as an opportunity for a student to try his prentice hand', although 'For the daughter of a high chief … an expert artist would be requisitioned'. Te Rangi Hiroa, 'Samoan Material Culture', _Bernice P. Bishop Museum Bulletin_ , LXXV (1930), p. 656. This might have been the case in the 1920s, but at the time of writing attitudes have shifted with the _malu_ being more significant than before.

8 MAKIKO KUWAHARA: MULTIPLE SKINS

[1](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-1) All tattooists are men as are their friends, and Tahitians who get heavily tattooed, frequent tattooists' places, and stay there for a long time are men. Half of the clients for most tattooists are women, but it is rare that female clients regularly visit the tattooists after they are tattooed. Thus, the relationships that are predominant at the site of tattooing are those between men.

[5](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-5) Eighty per cent of their clients are French military personnel and gendarmes.

[6](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-6) _Kokoro_ means 'penis' in Tahitian and 'heart' in Japanese. All Tahitians know this. _Mafatu_ means 'heart'.

[7](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-7) While Tahitian men include their male friends in the fictive family structure, they call women, not 'sister' or _soeur_ , but _copine_ ('girlfriend').

[8](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-8) Hawaiki Nui is an annual canoe race, which takes place in the Society Islands.

[9](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-9) Most tattooists know the works of the tattooists who are not really their friends because they have clients who come for modification and covering-up the old tattoos. Tattooists observe not only a bad tattoo but also the beautiful work of tattoos that have already been marked on the bodies of clients.

[10](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-10) _Le truck_ is the public bus, in which the passengers sit on the bench seats, facing each other.

[11](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-11) Some male Tahitians make money by selling marijuana (that contained in one matchbox costs from CFP 3,000 to CFP 5,000).

[12](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-12) During my fieldwork, I was staying at le Foyer de Jeune Fille, a girls-only dormitory run by the Evangelical Church.

[13](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-13) Pipipe is a tattooist, mostly working at his home or that of the tattooee. Pipipe has a speaking problem since birth and does not have a telephone. Most of Pipipe's clients, however, do not find it a problem. They just drop in and get tattooed, or arrange the time when Pipipe is at home.

[14](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-14) While networking by artisan-based and salon-based tattooists has developed, the tattooists working on the streets or at the residence remain outside the network.

[15](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-15) Tupuna has a real name, which is Edie, but his friends call him 'Tupuna'. Many young men hanging around in Outumaoro have a nickname and call each other by the nickname rather than by a real name.

[16](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-16) A tattooist's association was founded in 2000 after the International Tattoo Festival in Raiatea. It aims to organize the second Festival and to protect the rights over Polynesian tattoo motifs and designs. Currently only the full-time tattooists are members of the association; there are always many young people starting tattooing and they usually take some time to get in touch with older tattooists. In this sense, the gap between the full-time professional tattooists and parttime amateur tattooists has been extended through establishing the association.

[17](15_Chapter_08.xhtml#rref8-17) A tattooist in Moorea learned the traditional technique from a Samoan tattooist and started tattooing with the traditional tools.
