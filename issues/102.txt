## Task A

Add very minimal 'rich' support.

Replace the progress bar with a setup where processing of each file gets visualized by just two-row microtable: 

- In the 1st row on the left side we see the input path and on the right side we get the chunk progress bar (using rich progress bar). 
- In the 2nd line gets emitted at the end: on the left is the save path, and on the right the remaining API calls (drop the remaining tokens calculation). 

Make sure the text UI is extremely minimalistic, no borders etc. But color is OK. 

## Task B

If I give --recurse=GLOB_PATTERN

- input_data path becomes the input FOLDER, not file

- recurse pattern is the glob pattern which we apply to find files in the input_data

- output_data path becomes the output FOLDER, not file. If not given, we overwrite input files. If given, we replicate the file and subfolder structure in output_data the same as the file and subfolder structure relative to input_data

If --recurse is given, we also accept optional --workers defaulting to 4

If --recurse is given, the files get processed (with the same prompt etc.) in a parallelized way using the specified number of workers.
