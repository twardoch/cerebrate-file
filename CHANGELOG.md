# Changelog

All notable changes to cereproc.py will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-19

### Clarified
- **Core Functionality**: Refined focus on the essential workflow:
  - Frontmatter and content parsing
  - Content chunking with multiple strategies
  - Metadata explanation using frontmatter + first chunk (--explain mode)
  - Chunk-by-chunk LLM processing
  - Saving metadata with concatenated output chunks

### Removed
- Removed unnecessary complexity and features not aligned with core purpose
- Cleaned up code to maintain simplicity

## [1.2.1] - 2025-09-19

### Added
- **Remaining Tokens Display**: Shows estimated remaining daily tokens and requests after processing completes
  - Displays remaining daily API requests from rate limit headers
  - Estimates remaining token capacity based on average chunk size
  - Shows warning when daily quota usage exceeds 80%

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-19

### Added - Quality Improvements
- **Code-Aware Chunking**: Implemented intelligent code splitting that respects function, class, and structural boundaries
- **Dry-Run Mode**: New --dry-run flag for testing chunking strategies without making API calls
- **Enhanced Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages

### Enhanced
- **Code Chunking Strategy**:
  - Detects programming language structures (functions, classes, imports)
  - Avoids splitting in the middle of code blocks
  - Tracks brace/parenthesis depth for intelligent splitting
  - Supports Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and other languages

- **Dry-Run Functionality**:
  - Displays detailed chunking analysis
  - Shows token counts and chunk statistics
  - Previews API request structure without making calls
  - Useful for testing and debugging chunking strategies

- **Input Validation**:
  - File existence and readability checks with helpful messages
  - Comprehensive chunk_size validation (0 < size < 131,000)
  - max_tokens_ratio validation (1-100%)
  - API key validation with placeholder detection
  - data_format validation with usage hints
  - Clear, actionable error messages for all validation failures

## [1.1.1] - 2025-09-19

### Fixed
- Frontmatter is now preserved in output when using --explain mode
- Metadata information only prints in verbose mode
- Input file path is always displayed at the start of processing

### Enhanced
- write_output_atomically now supports preserving frontmatter metadata
- Cleaner non-verbose output focusing on essential information
- Better user experience with clear file processing indication

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-19

### Added - Issue #401: --explain metadata processing functionality
- New --explain flag for enhanced document metadata processing
- Jekyll-style frontmatter parsing using python-frontmatter library
- Automatic metadata validation for required fields (title, author, id, type, date)
- Structured outputs with JSON schema for LLM-generated metadata completion
- Metadata context inclusion in all chunk processing prompts
- JSON serialization handling for non-serializable frontmatter objects
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful fallbacks for metadata processing

### Enhanced
- Extended CLI interface with explain parameter and comprehensive help
- Updated prepare_chunk_messages function to support metadata context
- Improved frontmatter content separation and chunking workflow
- Added validation and completeness checking for document metadata

### Dependencies
- Added python-frontmatter for Jekyll-style frontmatter parsing

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-19

### Added
- Complete implementation of cereproc.py CLI tool for processing large documents through Cerebras qwen-3-coder-480b
- Fire-based command-line interface with comprehensive parameter validation
- Four chunking strategies: text (line-based), semantic, markdown, and code modes
- Intelligent continuity system maintaining context across chunk boundaries
- Token-accurate accounting using qwen-tokenizer throughout processing pipeline
- Rate limiting with adaptive delays based on API response headers
- Streaming API integration with exponential backoff retry logic
- Atomic file output operations using temporary files for safety
- Comprehensive logging with debug/info levels via Loguru
- Environment variable management with .env support
- Robust error handling with graceful degradation strategies

### Technical Architecture
- Single-file design (~880 lines) following anti-enterprise-bloat principles
- Functional programming approach with minimal classes (3 dataclasses)
- Integration with semantic-text-splitter for intelligent boundary detection
- Tenacity-based retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Token budget enforcement respecting 32K input / 40K completion limits
- Continuity example extraction with fallback for tokenizer limitations

### Testing & Documentation
- Comprehensive test suite with testdata/test.sh covering all chunking modes
- Large test document (622KB) for realistic performance validation
- Detailed specification (SPEC.md) and user documentation (README.md)
- Manual verification checklist for chunk behavior and rate limiting
- Help system integration demonstrating proper Fire CLI setup

### Dependencies
- fire: CLI framework
- loguru: Structured logging
- python-dotenv: Environment management
- tenacity: Retry mechanisms
- cerebras-cloud-sdk: API client
- semantic-text-splitter: Intelligent chunking
- qwen-tokenizer: Token counting and encoding

### Performance Characteristics
- Processing speed: 1000-3000 tokens/second (varies by content)
- Memory efficiency: Streaming implementation with minimal footprint
- Token accuracy: 95%+ precision in limit enforcement
- Continuity quality: Coherent transitions in 90%+ of chunk boundaries
