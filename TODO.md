# Cerebrate-File Pre-Screening Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Core Pre-Screening Function
- [x] Create `pre_screen_files` function in `src/cerebrate_file/recursive.py`
- [x] Add `output_file_exists` utility function in `src/cerebrate_file/file_utils.py`
- [x] Write unit tests for `pre_screen_files` function
- [x] Write unit tests for `output_file_exists` function

## Phase 2: CLI Integration
- [x] Modify recursive processing in `cli.py` to add pre-screening stage
- [x] Update progress reporting to show pre-screening results
- [x] Remove duplicate file existence check in `process_file_wrapper`
- [ ] Update CLI documentation and help text

## Phase 3: Single File Mode Consistency
- [x] Move single file existence check earlier in pipeline
- [x] Ensure consistent behavior between single and recursive modes
- [x] Test single file mode still works correctly

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [x] Create integration tests for recursive mode with pre-screening
- [x] Test progress reporting accuracy
- [x] Verify `--force` flag overrides pre-screening correctly
- [x] Create regression tests for existing functionality
- [x] Test dry-run mode compatibility
- [x] Test verbose/non-verbose output consistency

## Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with new feature
- [ ] Update README.md if needed
- [ ] Clean up any unused code
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
