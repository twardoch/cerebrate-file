Now /plan the following feature: 

In CLI, if --input_data is `-`, then we treat input as stdin (as if we're reading a single "file" from stdin). If --output_data is `-`, then regardless of type of output, we concatenate all outputs and output them into stdout. 

Then /work to implement the feature.
