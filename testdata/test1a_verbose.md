# CHAPTER TWO

## ‘Speckled Bodies’: Russian Voyagers and Nuku Hivans, 1804

Elena Govor

In 1804, a Russian naval expedition under the command of Adam Johann von Krusenstern (Ivan Fedorovich Kruzenshtern) and Yuri Fedorovich Lisiansky visited the Marquesas Islands. This voyage produced some of the most detailed and extensive visual documentation of Polynesian tattooing, particularly the full-body _te patu tiki_ of the Nuku Hivan men.

Unlike earlier European expeditions that had brief or violent encounters with the Marquesas, the Russian voyage was characterized by extended stays and more systematic ethnographic observation. The expedition's naturalists and artists were specifically instructed to document the peoples and cultures they encountered with scientific rigor.

The visual corpus from this expedition includes numerous detailed sketches and watercolors that capture not only the extensive tattooing of Marquesan men but also the social contexts in which these body markings were displayed. These images show tattooed figures engaged in various activities - dancing, fishing, crafting - providing a more holistic view of how tattooing functioned within Marquesan society.

The Russian observers were struck by the comprehensiveness of Marquesan tattooing. Unlike the more localized tattooing practices they had encountered elsewhere, the Marquesan men appeared to have their entire bodies covered in intricate patterns. The tattoos were described as consisting of:
- Dense geometric patterns covering limbs, torso, and face
- Motifs that included spirals, chevrons, and complex interlacing designs
- Distinctive facial markings that covered the entire countenance
- Elaborate designs on the hands and feet

The expedition's artists produced images that became widely circulated in European publications, establishing the Marquesas as a key reference point for discussions of Pacific tattooing. However, these canonical images actually depict a relatively small, closely associated group of individuals - members of what the Russians understood to be the royal family of Taiohae bay.

This chapter examines how these Russian encounters with Nuku Hivan tattooing practices both documented and transformed European understanding of Pacific body arts. The Russian voyagers, like their British predecessors, were fascinated observers who sought to understand and represent what they saw. But their longer stays and more systematic approach yielded richer documentation of both the technical processes of tattooing and its social meanings within Marquesan culture.

The encounter also reveals how Pacific peoples strategically presented themselves to foreign visitors. The individuals who posed for the Russian artists were likely chosen specifically because of their spectacular tattooing, serving as representatives of Marquesan cultural achievement. This selective presentation shaped European perceptions of Marquesan society and tattooing practices for generations to come.

The Russian expedition thus represents a crucial moment in the cross-cultural exchange of tattooing knowledge, documenting practices that were already changing due to contact with foreign visitors while simultaneously introducing these practices to a wider European audience through their publications and images.The reports and pictures of voyagers do inscribe fleeting early traces of dynamic, often ephemeral cultural practices such as indigenous Marquesan tattooing. In this chapter, moreover, I have argued that travellers' representations are not simple reflexes of metropolitan discourses and conventions but are also personal productions generated in the stress of cross-cultural encounters, where the agency of local people challenged visitors' predispositions and training and stamped ambiguous countersigns in what they wrote and drew. The ethno-historical utility of such a corpus of material thus derives from the complex interplay in its constitution between aesthetic or intellectual pre-programming, ethnocentrism, racial prejudice, precedence, experience and indigenous countersigns. Indigenous counter-signs are always distorted and often deeply camouflaged, but can be cast in sharper relief by exploiting tensions among the different media, genres and rhetorics of representation – as this chapter exemplifies.

The Russian expedition to Nuku Hiva in 1804 represents a particularly rich case study in this regard. Their extended stay and systematic documentation yielded unprecedented visual and textual records of Marquesan tattooing practices. Yet these accounts also reveal how Pacific peoples strategically presented themselves to foreign visitors, with individuals specifically chosen for their spectacular tattooing to serve as representatives of Marquesan cultural achievement. This selective presentation shaped European perceptions of Marquesan society and tattooing practices for generations to come.

The identification of specific historical personages – King Keatonui, his brother Pienui, the warrior Mufau, and the son-in-law Mouwateie – within the Russian visual corpus demonstrates both the ethno-historical value of such material and the methodological challenges it presents. The discrepancies between different portraits of the same individuals, produced by multiple artists working in different media and genres, highlight the instability of voyagers' testimonies, both written and pictorial. These variations exemplify the well-known phenomenon that eyewitness testimonies of the same event can vary wildly, especially when people confront the unusual in an agitated state of mind.

Furthermore, the Russian accounts reveal how cross-cultural encounters generated not only documentation but also transformation – both of the indigenous practices being observed and of the European observers themselves. The tattoo mania that seized the Russian visitors, leading them to mark their own bodies with both conventional inscriptions and indigenous motifs, demonstrates the powerful appeal of Pacific body arts and their capacity to transcend cultural boundaries. This adoption of tattooing by Europeans, documented so early in the contact period, establishes important precedents for understanding how indigenous Pacific practices were transmitted to and transformed within Western societies.

The Russian expedition thus represents a crucial moment in the cross-cultural exchange of tattooing knowledge, documenting practices that were already changing due to contact with foreign visitors while simultaneously introducing these practices to a wider European audience through their publications and images. Their accounts, with all their contradictions and complexities, remain foundational texts for understanding both Marquesan tattooing traditions and the broader history of Pacific-European cultural contact.# CHAPTER SEVEN

## The Pacific Arts of Tattooing:  
Contemporary Transformations

Nicole Luke

The transformation of Pacific tattooing traditions in the contemporary era reflects both continuity and change, as indigenous practices have been reinterpreted, revived and reimagined in response to new social, cultural and political contexts. While the suppression of tattooing by missionaries in the nineteenth century led to its disappearance in some island groups – notably in the Society Islands – other regions, such as Samoa, maintained their tattooing traditions despite missionary opposition. In recent decades, however, these traditional practices have undergone significant modifications and adaptations as they have been transmitted across the Pacific and reinterpreted within new diasporic communities.

The revival of tattooing in Tahiti and the Society Islands since the 1980s, for instance, has been heavily influenced by Samoan tattooing traditions, particularly through the work of Samoan _tufuga tatatau_ such as Sulu’ape Paulo, who tattooed the New Zealand artist Tony Fomison with a traditional _pe’a_ in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This cross-cultural transmission of tattooing knowledge has been facilitated by the movement of Pacific peoples throughout the region and into diaspora communities, particularly in New Zealand, Australia and the United States. As Pacific Islanders have migrated, they have carried their tattooing traditions with them, establishing new practices in urban environments while maintaining connections to their cultural origins.

In contemporary contexts, Pacific tattooing has evolved beyond its traditional religious and political functions to become a form of cultural expression that bridges indigenous and modern identities. The _tatau_ revival in Tahiti, for example, is not simply a return to pre-contact practices but a reimagining of these traditions within a modern framework. As Makiko Kuwahara notes in her contribution to this volume, the contemporary practice of _tatau_ in Tahiti incorporates both traditional motifs and new designs, reflecting the complex cultural negotiations that characterize modern Pacific societies.

The transformation of Pacific tattooing traditions in the contemporary era also reflects broader changes in the social and cultural landscape of the Pacific. As Anne D’Alleva argues in Chapter Four, the practice of _tatau_ in Samoa has been able to survive and even flourish because it was not as directly connected to religious practices as it was in the Society Islands. This distinction has allowed Samoan tattooing to adapt more readily to Christian contexts, while still maintaining its significance as a marker of cultural identity and social status.

In diasporic communities, Pacific tattooing has taken on new meanings and functions. For some Pacific Islanders living outside their home islands, tattooing becomes a way to maintain connections to their cultural heritage and to assert their identity within a broader multicultural context. The case of Tony Fomison, discussed by Peter Brunt in Chapter Six, illustrates how tattooing can become a site of cultural negotiation and identity formation, even for individuals who are not ethnically Pacific. Fomison’s decision to receive a traditional Samoan _pe’a_ was both a gesture of respect for Pacific cultural traditions and a statement about his own identity within the context of New Zealand’s evolving bicultural and multicultural landscape.

Yet this transformation of Pacific tattooing traditions in contemporary contexts is not without its tensions and contradictions. As Pacific tattooing has become more visible and accessible in global contexts, it has also become subject to appropriation and commodification. The popularity of Pacific-inspired tattoo designs among non-Pacific individuals in Western societies raises questions about cultural ownership and the ethics of cross-cultural exchange. While the sharing of tattooing knowledge across cultures has historical precedents – as explored in the Russian accounts discussed in the introduction to this volume – the contemporary context of globalization and commodification adds new layers of complexity to these exchanges.

The contemporary practice of Pacific tattooing also reflects ongoing debates about authenticity and tradition. As tattooing practices have been modified and adapted for new contexts, questions arise about what constitutes ‘authentic’ Pacific tattooing. Some practitioners and cultural advocates argue for strict adherence to traditional techniques and designs, while others embrace innovation and adaptation as necessary for the survival and evolution of these practices. These debates are not new – they have characterized Pacific tattooing since its earliest encounters with European visitors – but they have taken on new urgency in contemporary contexts where traditional practices are being revived and reimagined.

The role of tattooing in contemporary Pacific societies also reflects broader questions about the relationship between tradition and modernity. In some contexts, tattooing is viewed as a way to preserve and celebrate traditional cultural values, while in others it is seen as a hindrance to modernization and progress. These tensions are evident in the different trajectories of tattooing revival across the Pacific – while Samoa has maintained a continuous tradition of tattooing, other island groups have had to reconstruct their practices from historical accounts and contemporary adaptations.

Despite these tensions and contradictions, the contemporary transformation of Pacific tattooing traditions represents a significant moment in the ongoing cultural negotiations of Pacific societies. As these practices continue to evolve and adapt to new contexts, they remain powerful markers of cultural identity and social connection, bridging past and present, local and global, tradition and innovation. The persistence of Pacific tattooing in contemporary contexts – whether in its traditional forms or in new adaptations – speaks to the enduring significance of these practices as forms of cultural expression and social meaning-making.

The contemporary revival and transformation of Pacific tattooing also highlights the importance of considering these practices within broader frameworks of cultural continuity and change. As Sean Mallon argues in his contribution to this volume, the practice of tattooing in Samoa today is not simply a survival of pre-contact traditions but a dynamic cultural practice that continues to evolve and adapt. The work of contemporary _tufuga tatatau_ such as Sulu’ape Paulo demonstrates how traditional practices can be maintained while also being reinterpreted for new audiences and contexts.

This dynamic quality of contemporary Pacific tattooing is also evident in its global circulation and reception. As tattooing practices have moved beyond their Pacific origins, they have been embraced by diverse communities and individuals who find in them forms of personal and cultural expression. This global reception of Pacific tattooing practices reflects both the appeal of these designs and the complex cultural negotiations that characterize contemporary Pacific societies as they engage with broader global contexts.

The transformation of Pacific tattooing in contemporary contexts thus represents both a continuation of historical patterns of cultural exchange and adaptation, and a new moment in the global circulation of Pacific cultural practices. As these traditions continue to evolve, they remain central to understanding the dynamic cultural landscape of the Pacific and its ongoing engagement with both local and global contexts of meaning-making and identity formation.(...) the artist mimicked his oppressors, those with whom the powers of representation lie, who are masters of all the symbolic codes (like those well-camouflaged men in Holbein’s famous painting _The Ambassadors_). But they too are part of him. Remarkably, Grace’s photograph combines these two personas in a single image, thus dramatizing their dual and constitutive relationship, like the entangled therianthropes in _The Temptation of Brother Anthony_ , to the artist’s ‘self’. Moreover, the masquerade ensnares _us_ in that relationship, its viewers, _for whom_ the ‘self’ is here performed. In his guise as tattooed colonial castaway, Fomison stares us down, invites us to deal with him; implicates us in the same effort of his double to dominate him, read him, take his measure.

This performative aspect of tattooing – its capacity to stage identity, to provoke response, to create meaning through the interplay of marking and viewing – is central to understanding its role in contemporary Pacific societies. As we have seen in the previous chapters, tattooing practices are not static traditions but dynamic forms of cultural expression that adapt to new contexts while maintaining connections to ancestral knowledge systems. The work of tattooists like Su‘a Sulu‘ape Paulo and Eric demonstrates how these practitioners navigate between local expectations and global influences, creating new forms of cultural authority while remaining rooted in traditional aesthetic principles.

The transformation of tattooing from a localized practice to a global phenomenon has profound implications for how Pacific identities are constructed and perceived. In diasporic communities, tattooing becomes a technology of belonging, a way to maintain connection to homeland cultures while adapting to new social environments. The _taulima_ worn by young Samoans in Auckland or the detailed _tiki_ work of Tahitian practitioners like Aroma and Mano illustrate how tattooing serves as both ethnic marker and creative adaptation. These practitioners must balance respect for traditional forms with the demands of contemporary clients, often developing hybrid styles that speak to multiple cultural contexts.

Yet this globalization also creates tensions around cultural ownership and authenticity. The bestowal of Sulu‘ape titles upon non-Samoan practitioners reveals how traditional authority structures are being reimagined in transnational contexts. While some view this as cultural sharing, others see it as appropriation – a concern that reflects broader anxieties about how Pacific cultural practices are circulated and consumed in global markets. The same tensions emerge in Tahiti, where artisan-based practitioners distinguish themselves from salon-based tattooists, and in Aotearoa, where _moko_ wearers navigate between cultural expectation and personal choice.

These contemporary negotiations around tattooing highlight the complex relationship between tradition and innovation in Pacific societies. As cultural practices move across space and time, they inevitably transform, yet this transformation is not simply loss or dilution – it is also continuation and renewal. The electric tattoo machines used by modern _tufuga tatatau_ or the freehand techniques developed by Tahitian practitioners represent new technologies of tradition, ways of carrying ancestral knowledge into contemporary contexts while adapting to new possibilities and constraints.

The mobility of Pacific tattooists – their participation in international conventions, their work with global clientele, their circulation through digital media – demonstrates how cultural practices become part of broader networks of meaning-making. Yet this mobility also requires them to negotiate different sets of cultural protocols and expectations, to translate their practices across linguistic and aesthetic boundaries while maintaining their distinctive cultural character. In this way, Pacific tattooing continues to evolve as both local tradition and global practice, embodying the dynamic cultural flows that characterize contemporary Pacific societies.

## Beyond Modern Primitivism

Cyril Siorat

Ever since the needles have entered my skin and the ink has settled, the existential dimension of tattooing has been clear to me. Born in France, I moved to Moorea, in French Polynesia, aged 20. There I became a friend of Chime, a Marquesan tattoo artist. During my first year-long stay, Chime gave me three tattoos of Marquesan design. It was thirteen years, and several tattoos, later that I started to study the practice officially as an anthropologist. It was then that I became fully acquainted with the literature on tattoo milieux and with the academic debate regarding them. One of the main critiques of contemporary neo-tribal tattooing identifies this subculture under the rubric of 'modern primitive', and suggests that its practice reproduces old primitivist ideas. However, many of those involved today in body modification do not identify themselves in these terms and, although it is important to acknowledge that the wider spectrum of contemporary 'tribal' references does, almost inevitably, include neoprimitivist understandings, the milieux at present are too diverse to be reduced to what is, in fact, a reductionist critique. I argue that the 'modern primitive' label has been seized upon by commentators who have not considered how aptly it captures the contemporary practices, personal histories and motivations of the protagonists, and the ways that these have changed since the publication of the now notorious anthology _Modern Primitives_ in 1989.[1](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-1) This chapter attempts to rebut the critique, in particular through a consideration of the commodification of tattoos. I defend the contemporary movement from the charge that it is embedded above all in normative definitions of consumer culture.

Since the publication of _Modern Primitives_ in 1989 by the alternative arts press Re/Search,[2](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-2) there has been some discussion among social scientists regarding the identity and motivations of European and American individuals involved in the body modification movement. One of the main criticisms has been that such movements are involved in the facile idealization of the exotic 'Other'. In consequence, so the argument goes, they perpetuate classic primitivist assumptions. Modern primitives are, according to Klesse, a 'legacy of colonialism in late imperial culture'.[3](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-3) It is easy to feel confused about the identity of 'modern primitives', considering the multiple networks of which the tattoo community is formed. It seems that if there is such a thing as a 'modern primitive' movement, it is likely to be localized, on the west coast of the USA, and within the context of a network evolving around particular individuals such as Fakir Musafar. In London, home to a dynamic body modification community, I am still to find someone who would define her or himself as a 'modern primitive'. I am not suggesting that people in London were not inspired by the _Modern Primitives_ publication, and subsequent work in that field, but that the identity marker 'modern primitive' seems to be almost always assigned by non-body modifier individuals, 'in the know', rather than used as a self-expression of identity.

Rather than being rigid and inflexible, individual and group identities have always been involved in a constant dialectical process involving the other, as both the Polynesian revival and the changing global tattoo community shows. 'Individual identity is located within a two-way social process, an interaction of "ego" and "other", inside and outside. It is in the meeting of internal and external definition that identity, whether collective or individual, is created'.[4](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-4) Therefore, 'identification is never a unilateral process; at the very least there is always an audience'.[5](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-5) In that sense, publications from the 'modern primitive' movement could be regarded as internal definition, while academic work scrutinizing them is an external definition.

I would argue, however, that both should be conceptualized as external to the multiple body modification networks and to the individuals involved in these networks. Different features of these external definitions will coincide or differ from the internal definition of the individuals involved in body modification practices, giving rise either to negative or positive confirmation of the perceived internal identity. Therefore, considering that identification processes are constant, social scientists should be careful not to assign the label 'modern primitive' to any individual involved in body modification and who refers in some way or another to 'tribalism' or to an urge to modify their bodies.

Another aspect of the 'modern primitive' publications and term is that they are ironic. There is an awareness that nobody can be a 'primitive', hence the addition of 'modern' to the term, and that the association of these two terms collapses a popular dichotomy. These publications are important media of self-promotion and self-expression rather than academically sanctioned arguments. Many of the contributors to _Modern Primitives_,[6](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-6) do not refer to themselves as 'modern primitives' but share some sensibilities with some aspects of the agenda of this particular network. Therefore caution should be applied when categorizing such networks, and one should be aware of the danger of objectifying the Other and denouncing such processes in the past while, at the same time, participating in current categorization of 'others'. Furthermore, I do not believe that irony invalidates personal narratives and embodied experiences as scholars such as Turner seem to imply.[7](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-7) If the ironists always hold their views of the world in doubt,[8](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-8) it is because, as Beck argues:

Doubt . . . which not only serves science but now, applied reflexively, disrupts and destroys the latter's false and fragile clarities and pseudo-certainties, could become the standard for a new modernity which starts from the principles of precaution and reversibility. Contrary to a widespread mistake, doubt makes everything – science, knowledge, criticism and morality – possible once again, only different, a couple of sizes smaller, more tentative, personal, colourful and open to social learning. Hence it is also more curious, more open to things that are contrary, unsuspected and incompatible, and all this with the tolerance that is based in the ultimate final certainty of error.[9](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-9)

The term 'modern primitive' was coined by an individual called Fakir Musafar in the late 1970s to describe himself and a few other people who were following a similar personal path. Born in 1930, Fakir Musafar has been a pioneer in the practice of body modification, such as piercing and branding, and has been involved in modifying his body for the last 50 years. Now called 'the father of modern primitivism', Fakir Musafar spent a great time experimenting in secret. 'Unfortunately, I was driven into deep isolation and shame . . . for lack of any social sanction . . . I knew that if I let it be known what I felt and what I was doing, I would probably have been institutionalised'.[10](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-10) This led him to find, in past and present painful rituals from around the world, some form of sanction. He found social sanction in the fact that body modification behaviours were deemed acceptable, and often desirable, in diverse human cultures. In a way, this yearning for social sanction of types of behaviour considered too deviant in mainstream Western society could be interpreted as a plea for inclusion rather than exclusion. Body modification, then, could be seen not as a rebellious act but a confirmation of one's alterity. This is also a form of resistance but not a conflictual one.

Resistance has often been understood as a binary opposite of domination. However, if power is dispersed, multiple and relational, as Foucault argues, then resistance must also be diffuse, decentred – an integral part of power rather than its opposite. As Rosenblatt points out, resistance does not mean activities that 'escape existing systems of meaning';[11](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-11) acts are inevitably formed in relation to the society from whence they come. He argues that so-called 'modern primitives' position themselves in a conflictual opposition to capitalist consumption and Christianity when in fact their beliefs reflect certain Christian ideas about the relationship of the individual self to society.[12](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-12) I would disagree with Rosenblatt's assertion that modern primitives' own view is necessarily simplistically conflictual; it can also be seen as a plea for an inclusion of alterity within mainstream society.

This plea could also be perceived as a demand, a demand that the boundaries of what is civilized and what is primitive be collapsed into an ironic, contrary and problematic statement. Nonetheless, it is true that the discourse of Fakir Musafar reifies some popular Western primitive conceptions that are grounded in colonial discourse and gaze, as Klesse argues.[13](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-13) It is also true that a lot of tattoo artists and tattooed individuals do have fairly naïve and simplistic ideas about what tribal tattoos represent and what a Euro-American person becomes by taking them on. In that sense, Rosenblatt is right to argue that most references to primitive in the West have more to do with a perceived lost social sense of the self, of Euro-American individuals, than with any non-Western cultures.[14](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-14) It is, however, also important to note that the Western concept of the primitive has sometimes been taken as an identity marker by colonized population themselves. Furthermore, the tattoo and body modification milieu is heterogeneous. There seems to be a gulf between an individual who is getting a pseudo tribal tattoo in Europe, in the absence of much knowledge of its origins and meanings, and who probably holds a fairly naïve set of New Age motivations, and the smaller network of people who are more actively part of a genuinely cross-cultural community, and who are engaged in something different from consumerist appropriation.

In California in the early 1170s Fakir Musafar went public and gave a performance of ritual piercing in a tattoo convention. From then on, his experimentation with body modification influenced and inspired different sub-cultural networks, sado-masochism (S&M) and punk, for example. That Musafar chose to give his first public performance at an event organized by the tattoo community is indicative of the strength of the tattooing networks at that time. From the 1960s onwards, as Benson argues, the tattoo community went through great changes 'increasing international communication, technical innovation and the work of a number of key individuals, many from art school backgrounds, radically transformed the possibilities of the medium'.[15](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-15) Through the 1980s an increasing interest developed among some tattoo artists for traditional tattoo designs from places where a tattoo tradition had been, or was still part of the cultural array of symbolic expressions. By the late 1980s the work of the Filipino-American tattoo artist Leo Zulueta, among a few others, became an inspiration worldwide in the development of such styles, and although he appears in the publication _Modern_ Primitives, he does not refer to himself as one.[16](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-16) His work does not entail an underlying desire to be the 'Other'. Rather, he equates his research into traditional designs as conservation of an aesthetic tradition: 'all the old men having "primitive"-style tattoos are dead. . . . The last man to have a back piece like mine, who was over ninety years old, passed away a couple of years ago. This is why I really feel strongly about preserving those ancient designs'.[17](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-17) He also acknowledges the possibility that the 'original' meanings of these designs may never be understood in the contemporary setting. His work does not, however, entail a conservation of the designs in the butterfly collector's manner. They are preserved on their original medium, the human skin. It would also seem that for some tattooists, at least, the search is not for a mythical primitive 'Other' but for themselves. Leo Zulueta, for example, is half Filipino and grew up in Hawaii, suggesting perhaps that the inner motivations of body modifiers are complex, varied, and often rooted in personal cross-cultural biographies rather than mono-dimensional ones.

While the 'neo-tribal /black work' tattoo styles were developing momentum in North America and Europe, other tattoo communities were also involved in major evolutions. Tattooing was a prominent procedure throughout Polynesia, before its colonization. In French Polynesia, for example, Christian missions and the colonial authorities stopped the practice of tattooing for more than a century. Since the late 1970s, however, tattooing has been revived by Ma'ohi (native Polynesian) cultural agents (traditional dance troupes and other artists). It is now highly visible and a growing aspect of the local tourist industry. The traditional Tahitian and Marquesan designs that are tattooed today in French Polynesia are also important cultural and social identity markers (see Kuwahara, this volume).

During the last fifteen years, Ma'ohi tattoo artists have themselves been influenced and inspired by different cultural tattoo designs and styles, including Samoan and also North American and European 'black work'. Polynesian tattooists also became regular guests at tattoo conventions in North America and Europe. They forged strong relationships and created global networks with 'tribal' practitioners. A great influence throughout the 1990s was that of the late Paulo Sulu'ape from Western Samoa, where there has been a continuity of practice throughout the colonial and post-colonial periods (see Mallon, this volume). Sulu'ape introduced many tattooists to traditional methods of tattooing and inspired many others by communicating the meanings and context of the Samoan designs he tattooed in many non-Samoan skins. In Tahiti, however, it is paradoxical that the forms and meanings of contemporary Ma'ohi tattoos are reconstructed from representations produced by explorers and colonial agents in the nineteenth century. In my view, 'authentic' Ma'ohi tattooists are therefore involved in a similar process of recontextualizing symbols as are the 'inauthentic' so-called modern primitives.

### TATTOOS AND COMMODIFICATION

At this point, I would like to explore the involvement of tattoos in consumer culture since it is often used as a challenge to their authenticity. Through this discussion, I intend to develop further some of the points raised in this introductory section. It has been argued that tattoos, and body modifications in general, 'do not escape commodification',[18](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-18) that they 'can be purchased for money like other commodities'[19](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-19) and should 'be interpreted in the context of an increasingly trendy aestheticization and commodification of ethnic difference'.[20](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-20) On the other hand, it has also been argued that body modifications 'differ from other "free-floating" commodities, not only because of their status as permanent or "semi-permanent" modifications to the body, but also because of the necessary physicality of their production'[21](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-21) and the pain that accompanies such practices.[22](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-22) The permanent aspect of tattoos render them 'the ultimate' in anti-fashion.[23](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-23) In other words, there are two views regarding tattoos and commodity. The first is that tattoos have been commoditized. Anyone can walk into a tattoo shop, choose a design, pay and come out with a new tattoo. The socio-cultural context of the design is irrelevant; it could be argued that the tattoo as a product is alienated. The second perspective considers tattoos to be potent anti-commodity symbols due to their non-exchangeability, their permanence and their personal nature. Although divergent, these two views do not contradict each other since they both focus on different times in the biography of a tattoo. There is a popular belief in Western culture that things are either commodities or are not. At one pole are things that 'represent the natural universe of commodities' and 'at the opposite pole we place people, who represent the natural universe of individuation and singularization'.[24](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-24) However, this is a relatively recent dichotomy.

Works by Appadurai[25](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-25) and Thomas[26](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-26) emphasize, in their respective definitions of commodities, the importance of context. Appadurai suggests that 'commodity . . . refers to things that, at a certain _phase_ in their careers and in a particular _context_ , meet the requirements of commodity candidacy'.[27](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-27) The commodity candidacy here is understood to mean 'the standards and criteria that define the exchangeability of things in any particular social and historical context'.[28](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-28) Anything, therefore, can become a commodity in the time of its existence as long as it meets the candidacy requirements of its context. When things do not meet the commodity candidacy, they become singular and have reached a different phase in their status. Thomas presents commodities 'as objects, persons, or elements of persons, which are placed in a context in which they have exchange value and can be alienated. The alienation of a thing is its dissociation from producers, former users, or prior context'.[29](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-29) The alienability of things or persons is crucial to their status as commodities. If such dissociation cannot be attained, objects may become 'artefacts which tell a story'.[30](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-30) Furthermore Kopytoff's definition of commodities emphasizes the importance of the discrete nature of the exchange. This is 'in order to stress that the primary and immediate purpose of the transaction is to obtain the counterpart value'.[31](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-31) This is in contrast to gift exchanges where rules of relations of reciprocity should apply. At this point, how-ever, it should be made clear that commodity exchange is not a feature of modern societies and gift exchange a feature of traditional societies. Both systems seem to exist, to varying degrees of popularity, in all human societies. The root of the commodity seems to lie in the action of exchange. Exchange, being at the root of human social life and a universal feature of it, makes commodities a universal aspect of culture.[32](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-32) The commodity status is therefore a flexible one; a phase in a biography, and commoditization a 'process of becoming'.[33](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-33) The commodity must be alienable from its origins and its exchange does not entail any further obligations or expectations. Moreover, there seems to be a constant conflictual relationship between the drive to extend the arena of commodity exchange, and widen the range of available commodity items, and a human need for the singularization of particular items or range of items. The former is inherent to the exchange technology, while the latter is motivated by individuality and culture.[34](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-34)

The rise, in the nineteenth century, of new exchange technologies[35](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-35) and of a materialist culture and new types of consumption, avid of products from all over the world,[36](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-36) was instrumental to a rapid expansion of the process of commoditization and, in turn, to the capitalist system. Appa-durai,[37](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-37) quoting the work of Sombart, links this new type of consumption to the demands of the bourgeois and nobility classes for luxury goods. Luxuries should not be regarded as the opposite of necessities but rather as 'goods whose principal use is rhetorical and social, goods that are simply incarnated signs'.[38](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-38) Luxuries are part of a particular register of consumption rather than a special class of things.[39](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-39) Similarly, I would propose that tattoos are also part of a particular register of consumption. I do not want to argue that tattoos are luxury items reserved for the elites, but rather that they represent incarnated signs for marginal communities; a luxurious symbol of otherness.

There are five main attributes that should be displayed by incarnated signs as commodities. These are restriction to elites, complexity of acquisition, semiotic virtuosity, regulation by fashion, and 'a high degree of linkage of their consumption to body, person, and personality'.[40](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-40) While tattoos would not have to display all of these attributes to qualify as an incarnated sign involved in a particular register of consumption, I would argue that they do. Take, for example, the criterion of restriction to elites: although it is clear that they are not restricted to an elite _per se_, until recently their access was restricted to certain groups of people. Today, even if the restriction seems have been removed to an extent, tattoos still have a certain degree of difficulty of access. To start with, tattoo artists' rates are not cheap. Another restriction can be the painful nature of the tattooing process, which may not appeal to all. And finally the prospective tattooee may consider the social restrictions imposed on future social interactions based on pre-conceptions of tattoos – for example, difficulty in finding employment. When the production technology of incarnated signs becomes more advanced and able to produce these articles in increased numbers and at a lower price, they become more accessible to anyone and therefore lose their restriction attribute.[41](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-41) This shift, from different spheres of exchange value, seems to manifest itself as a shift from issues of exclusivity to issues of authenticity.[42](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-42) I would like to propose that a similar shift has happened in the tattoo world.

Up to three decades ago, tattoos were mainly acquired by marginal groups. These were, in the West, soldiers, sailors, criminals and people involved in body modification, such as tattoo artists themselves. Most incarnated signs symbolized belonging to particular groups and/or the partaking of particular activities, for example, military regiments, port of calls, time in jail and allegiance to a pimp. Tattoos were the quasi-exclusivity of these groups. However, in the last fifteen years, tattoos have become part of popular culture. They are used in advertising campaigns to portray, among other things, sexual attractiveness. There has been an invasion, of the high streets in the West, of roses, dolphins, yin & yang, and other small tattoos. I would argue that the exclusivity of tattoos was threatened by a shift towards a perceived common, or more mainstream, sphere of exchange value. The shift from different spheres of exchange value moved, similarly to the one mentioned above, from issues of exclusivity to issues of authenticity, or rather here of authenticities. The first authenticity I am referring to has to do with authenticity of commitment. It could be argued that as small tattoos became more popular, people involved in the body modification movement had to engage more extensively with these embodied incarnated signs. Bigger tattoos and body-suits, as well as extensive piercings, became a way to authenticate this commitment, one sign of this exclusivity being tattoos that cannot be hidden by clothes. The second authenticity has to do with the origin and process of tattooing itself.

As I noted earlier, an important aspect of the tattoo revival is the tribal and traditional styles and the tattoo artists involved in this style. Designs used as tattoos can be found worldwide and, in the late 1970s and '80s, some Western tattoo artists started to use some of these designs as inspirations (for the longevity of this process of exchange and innovation, see Mallon, this volume). However, the cultural context of such design was mainly unrelated to its use in tattoo shops; the designs were alienated and therefore commoditized. However, some individuals involved in this revival wanted artefacts, designs that told stories, rather than alienated commodities, and travelled to encounter and engage with the places of origin of some of these designs. Oceania was one of the instrumental locations of these encounters. Authenticity became a question of context. Context includes here both the place in which, and the person from whom, one will get a tribal or traditional tattoo. Similar designs tattooed in Cardiff by a home-based tattoo artist; in London by a renowned tribal tattoo artist; in Auckland by a Maori tattoo artist; and in Madrid at a tattoo convention by a mixed race Polynesian tattoo artist with traditional tools all have greatly different degrees of authenticity.

It has been argued that 'traditional Maori . . . signs are woven into global consumerism, where they are endlessly modernised, producing a complex hybridisation of signs and messages'.[43](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-43) Rather than equating the presence of Maori tattoos with a destructive modernization, however, the development of the 'neo-tribal', also called 'black work', can be perceived as another period in that style. By this I mean that there can be no exact replicas of something. However rigid and static a ritual, a style or a practice may be to the outside observer, however rooted in tradition they may seem, the enactment will always be a reinterpretation of the past and therefore different from it. There is a change from the use of these designs in their original context, but there is a certain continuity regarding their use as modes of embodied symbolic expressions in varied contexts.

It may be that these abstract designs, rather than the personal statement, attract many people, because the latter can be easily (mis)read. Further more, Phillips and Steiner[44](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-44) have argued that a possible way to define it may reside 'in the very process of collection, which inscribes, at the moment of acquisition, the character and qualities that are associated with the object in both individual and collective memories'.[45](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-45) The authenticity of a tattoo similarly may reside in that moment when, inscribed in the body, it acquires the character and qualities of the individual, and collective perceptions of the context from which it arose. In that sense, tattoos can be read adequately only through the context of their creation and the discourse used to convey the personal narrative attached to them, but this context does not rely on some originary, 'tribal' or traditional source. Furthermore, I agree with Sullivan's conclusion[46](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-46) that

bodily inscription is not so much a writing with or on the body (both of which assume a body-subject that pre-exists writing), but rather it is an infinite (re)writing and (re)reading of the body-subject in and through its relations with carnal sensuosity of the Other and the world, and with culturally and historically specific social fictions.[47](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-47)

It could therefore be argued that tattoos are in fact constant changing processes that can be 'read' synchronically.

The absence of reciprocity relations, inherent in the discrete nature of commodity exchange, does not mean that such exchanges will be non-personal encounters. For example, as Thomas explains,[48](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-48) in New Georgia ritual knowledge, and to an extent ritual agency, can be 'purchased' from specialists. The names of these specialists are important to the purchasers and it could be assumed that there was an ongoing particular relationship between the two. However, although 'the practice of ritual may often have involved reference to the source of knowledge, to the empowering authority, . . . in such contexts the allusion to the name figures as authentication and validation, rather than as the expression of longer-term indebtedness'.[49](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-49) This is similar to the way that some tattoos gain authenticity. The name of the tattoo artist is important but does not imply that there is any relationship beyond the particular time spent acquiring the tattoo. The nature of the exchange can vary, however, according to context. There are a number of differences in the nature of the exchange depending on the identities of prospective tattooed individuals and their relationship with the tattoo artist. The price of a tattoo is usually a negotiation, and may or may not involve money. Furthermore, tattoo artists' rates do not seem to be influenced greatly by market forces. Thus it could also be possible that tattooing exchanges are sometimes more akin to Firth's 'exchange by private treaty', a situation in which something like price is arrived at by some negotiated process other than the impersonal forces of supply and demand.[50](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-50) Therefore, it seems that the nature of the exchange of tattoos can vary, depending on context and individual perceptions, from commodity exchange to gift exchange via exchange by private treaty.

Individual perceptions of the nature of the exchange have a great influence, I believe, on determining the status of a tattoo in the commodity spheres. When the prospective tattooed individual chooses a template design and does not engage in any further exchange relations with the tattoo artist, except by name for authentication purposes, the tattoo can be perceived as commoditized. According to this view, a tattoo is a commodity at the time of its exchange and becomes a singularized symbol once decommoditized. The fact that it cannot be exchanged could also classify it as a terminal commodity; that is, not intended for further exchange.[51](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-51) However, one of the interesting aspects of the exchange of tattooing is that, most of the time, it is not directly the tattoo that is valued, but rather the time of the tattoo artist. It could be argued that what is bought is the skill and expertise of the artist and that therefore it is these that are commoditized rather than the tattoo itself. Furthermore, in a sense, the tattoo as an object does not exist until after the exchange: until it is finished. Up to that point it is only the Platonic form of a tattoo. Once finished, it will become a singular entity and therefore will move out of the commodity phase of its biography. In other words, the tattoo is only a commodity during its own process of becoming a singular entity – prior to its birth. None the less, many people will use the financial cost of a tattoo as one of its defining markers. There seems to be no doubt that exclusivity is symbolized through financial restriction. This view, in a sense, assigns to the singular tattoo an identity marker normally associated with commodities, price being a primary symbol of a discrete transaction. Thus, my point is that a tattoo is never really commoditized. On the one hand, it is the skill and time of the tattoo artists that are commoditized, not the tattoo itself. And on the other hand, it is sometimes given the identity of a commodity, as a symbol of exclusivity on financial grounds, when it has already become a singular entity.

Complex societies are prone to yearn for singularization.[52](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-52) It is interesting to note that the rise in popularity of tattoos, and of body modifications in general, coincides with different expansions of the spheres of values and increased momentum towards wider commoditization/ommodification. It seems difficult to decide if this is mainly due to a shift in the practice of tattooing towards a different sphere of value or if it emanates from an attraction towards a symbol of embodied singularization. The Western perspective that polarizes people and things, the singular and the commodity, considers the human body to be the most singularized entity. Tattoos will therefore assume a particular place in that polarity. Furthermore, 'power often asserts itself symbolically precisely by insisting on its right to singularize an object, or a set or class of objects'.[53](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-53) There-fore, individuals can symbolically assert their power by their attempts to singularize objects. Thus, tattoos could be perceived as a relevant medium for such symbolic expressions. None the less, there seems to be a paradox in the sense that, however singularized the personal information contained in a tattoo may be, the mainstream use of this particular media will tend to pull it away from its regime of consumption, and lessen its potency as a symbol of embodied singularization.

My analysis therefore leads me towards a view that tattoos themselves are not commodities. However, a phase of their biographies is commoditized; that is, in the process of becoming. What seems therefore to be engaged in the battle between commoditization and singularization is the nature of the exchange; in a sense tattooing rather than tattoos. Depending on the context and on the protagonists involved, and their respective perceptions of the nature of the exchange, tattooing could be classified either as commodity exchange, gift exchange or exchange by private treaty. This flexibility seems to enable the tattoo communities to deal with the popularity of the practice, and offers an array of possible relationships to choose from during complex encounters with a wide range of individuals. This is why, I feel, it is futile to describe 'traditional' tattoos as expressions of 'thick/hot' social relationships, and contemporary tattoos as only able to create, and stem from, 'thin/cold' ones.[54](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-54)

Furthermore, tattoos, and body modifications in general, demand a positive engagement with pain and suffering. This, I believe, indicates that a particular type of relationship may be forged through such experiences. This is because the 'particularly un-negotiable sensation which is pain when involved in ritual, 'acts to embed . . . a connection within a larger network of inter-personal ties . . . a network of relationships'.[55](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-55) These webs of relationships involve multi-dimensional connections among people, places and the social, cultural and historical narratives attached to them, and evolve within the symbolic, aesthetic and political spheres at play in the human condition.

In the Euro-American world, body modification is considered a matter of choice, but body modifications are only optional, in fact, as long as one does not want to belong to a body modification network. Within those networks, they arguably remain a form of initiation ritual.[56](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-56) In this context, however, the transformation of the person has to do less with coming of age and more with an acceptance of personal alterities and a symbol of a 'capacity for intense experience'.[57](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-57) In this, pain is instrumental because its 'social signification . . . is to give a sharper dimension to memory by welding the community through the same references'.[58](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-58) If, further, as Jackson has argued,[59](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-59) the world of constant pain cannot be understood by non-sufferers, because pain 'shatters language',[60](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-60) it could be that these group references exist at the pre-objective level of experience, before it is expressed through language. It can be argued that pain, because it is experienced through the body, can be conceived as an emotion and as such 'contains much that is indeterminate and inchoate, [and so] it is often poorly served by everyday-world language'.[61](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-61) This experience, which can be said to be shared beyond any narratives, could act as a perceived inter-subjectivity across culture and time. This could also account for the 'primal urge' to modify their bodies often cited by body modifiers.

The last point I would like to make is that there is an important aspect of the relationship between pain and tattoos that is clear in the popular adage: 'pain is unavoidable, suffering is optional'. This is a demand not only for the tattooee to engage positively with the painful experience, but also, I believe, a more general demand of a shift of values away from those preached by a form of Protestant humanism that denies the individual its capacity to suffer. Therefore, 'body modification initiates its adepts into a cruel ritual system incommensurable with mainstream religious practice'.[62](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-62) It is, however, crucial to understand that the point is not solely in the pain but also, and in some ways more importantly, in its relief. 'There is a power, innate to all pain, after the relief, an initiatic dimension, a solicitation to live more intensely the consciousness of existence . . . [pain] gives a sense of life's price . . . [and] is a radical principle of metamorphosis'.[63](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-63) This seems to be a recurrent theme raised by my informants. As Stephen, one of them, puts it: 'I feel a lot more alive after each tattoo session. It is almost like a doctor, but not to make you better but to make you feel alive. This is why I get tattooed more and more. It is the sensation of pinching yourself to know if you are awake.' Finally, I would like to suggest that, although some body modifiers' discourse expresses a kind of 'corporeal absolutism',[64](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-64) their tentative assertions of symbolic power over their suffering bodies may have the effect that 'by controlling this violence, by sculpting it with devotion at the heart of the self, [human beings] subordinate their condition rather than submit to it'.[65](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-65)

This article has shown that the ironic term 'modern primitive' cannot be used as a blanket identity marker to describe these global cross-cultural networks. Through the discussion on issues of commodification, I attempted to show the complexity and heterogenous nature of the global tattooing community. The level to which such networks are involved in consumer culture and society as a whole tend to imply that, at least for some body modifiers, the agenda is inclusion of their alterity rather than simplistic rebellion.

## EPILOGUE

## Embodied Exchanges and their Limits

Nicholas Thomas

In a recent documentary on tattoo, one of the interviewees is a German woman. She enthuses about the topic. She leans close to the camera and says: 'Once you have one tattoo, you will want more.' This is a deceptively simple statement, but one that arguably speaks volumes about contemporary Euro-American tattooing. It tells us, specifically, what motivates and requires tattooing, and what ontological register tattoos occupy. People get tattoos, in this conception, because they have an individual desire or appetite for them. They are things that you 'want'. They are also things that can exist in a series. One gets one, then another, and then another.

It is obvious that a tattoo such as the _pe'a_ is not generally obtained because it is merely wanted. It, like many other Polynesian body modifications, is obtained because it or they are cosmologically or socially required (if nevertheless also desired), in one specific sense or another. And it will also be apparent that although the _pe'a_ is made up of a distinct components, it consists neither of a series of those components nor as an element in a series itself. It is a unity and a totality, not a form susceptible to numeration. The same may be said of the _malu_, even though the woman's form may appear, superficially, to be composed out of a set of discrete elements.

Hence, if a Euro-American subject obtains a _pe'a_ or _malu_ among other tattoos, he or she arguably draws that form away from its cultural predicates. This drawing away, abstraction from, or appropriation, is in any case present in the fact that the Euro-American subject approaches either the male or female Samoan tattoo, not as something socially required, but as one among a range of 'tattoos', one among a possible repertoire of 'neo-tribal' and other tattoos that may be available for a desiring subject's acquisition. Just _how_ available a Samoan tattoo may be to a non-Samoan man or woman is another matter. To acknowledge that _pe'a_ and _malu_ are not simply there for the taking from tattoo studios – but have been taken on, rather, by non-Samoans who, like Fomison, occupy certain relationships with Samoans, already complicates a line of argument that might be developed, on the basis of the juxtaposition I have made, between the cultural underpinnings of Samoan and Euro-American tattoos.

That juxtaposition is consistent with a classical, culturally relativist anthropology that would locate _tatau_ and tattoo within different cultural orders. It is moreover consistent with some (but not all) indigenous Polynesian understandings, which situate Samoan _tatau_ or Maori _ta moko_ in domains that are integrated and distinct. The model that underlies these understandings of difference is, of course, that of language: it is self-evident that Samoan and Maori are different from each other and different from English, and we can see the negotiation between them as a matter of inherently imperfect translation. This way of understanding cultural variety is both implicitly persuasive and manifestly problematic. Language itself is the most compelling of metaphors, and at one level nothing seems more natural than modelling cultural upon linguistic difference. This is not the place to rehearse either the valid aspects or the many real pitfalls of these assumptions in general. The point can merely be made that the case of tattooing – or rather that of _tatau_/tattoo – sits uneasily within these terms. A Euro-American person does not bear a 'translation' of the _pe'a_ but the _pe'a_ itself, yet a _pe'a_ that has been at least partially, and perhaps very profoundly recontextualized.

The examples reviewed in this book suggest that it is vital to position cultural forms in terms different to those presumed by the longstanding debates around cultural relativism. Relativism was always explicitly or implicitly opposed to universalism, whereby sexual mores, psychological attitudes or art symbols were always from one perspective locally distinctive valuations, or from the other the effects of structural, cognitive or biological constants. The materials considered here are cross-cultural from the start, which is to say neither culturally unique nor universal. Each Polynesian _tatau_ tradition represented a particular transformation of others. Each modern _tatau_ and tattoo practice drew upon, differentiated itself from, and sustained or forgot antecedent practices. These transformations were possible and are possible because tattoo practices and tattoos have possessed cross-cultural efficacy and salience as well as culturally specific meaning. That cross-cultural efficacy has entailed the potential for their interested recognition and misrecognition, the possibility that they may be adopted or appropriated rather than ignored.

The cases considered in this book, moreover, also displace the comparative operation from theory to history. Those interested in cross-cultural analysis have, as it were, been beaten to the game by Rutherford and Sulu'ape as well as many before, between and since. Those actors, who applied or assumed cross-cultural tattoos, engaged in translation, or rather transposition and recontextualization. They pre-empted the question of whether and how _tatau_ could be taken from one cultural milieu into another – by simply doing it.

If we recognize that _tatau_ was even, in its varied pre-colonial Polynesian expressions, always already a cross-cultural, historically shaped adaptation, that does not alter the point that, within specific societies, it assumed particular values and meanings – meanings that may indeed be as coherent and distinctive as the Tahitian, Samoan and Maori languages. To acknowledge this would seem only to take us back to the point that I have made and retreated from – that the Samoan tattoo specifically has a singular motivation and logic, even an ontology, which the tattoo form itself can be abstracted from, but which is not susceptible to translation.

It remains important to affirm this point – that different modes of tattooing may be fundamentally distinct in their predicates, in the notions of the person, the body, and society, that underlie them. But, just as languages may diverge, merge or otherwise change, the absoluteness of this distinct integrity may become historically compromised. It is evident that since at least the mid-twentieth century, when Groves produced his drawings, that the classic Samoan _pe'a_ could coexist with other tattoo (not _tatau_) forms. And that has clearly become far more common more recently. This does not mean that the _pe'a_ or _malu_ no longer has its own highly distinctive qualities, but that those qualities cannot be associated with one culture that is located in Samoa, and juxtaposed with another that is located in Europe or America. It is evident rather that both logics may appear, in compromised forms, on the one body. This instance might appear only as one of what anthropologists used to call 'acculturation', otherwise labelled syncretism, creolization or hybridity.

But at this point it needs to be recalled that Samoan _tatau_ is only one among many Poly-nesian practices. In Tahiti, _tatau_ incorporated both a unitary whole – the standard blacked buttocks and arches – _and_ potentially a series of idiosyncratic elements. In other words, the art form already incorporated distinctive predicates. It is vital that we do not underestimate the complexity and heterogeneity of Pacific art – which cannot be recognized purely as a collectively motivated practice, which may be culturally or ontologically juxtaposed to Western values. If we accept that the form the Western tattoo took – that is, that of the individually desired, individual motif – already existed within the Polynesian tattoo world it is not only our understanding of indigenous tattoo traditions that must change. 'Translation' seems, less than ever, the right term. Nor is it any longer obvious that the Europeans who take on 'neo-tribal' tattoos necessarily perpetrate an invidious distortion of indigenous values. In some cases they certainly do, but in others they may not. The issue can be adjudicated only by talking about which people, when, in the contexts of what cross-cultural dealings. Kabris's case is not the same as Rutherford's, and Rutherford's is not the same as Fomison's. To look at tattooing now – to look at _tatau_/tattoo now – is like looking through a kaleidoscopic device. When you turn the tube, every element of the world changes, to fall into place – or not – in a new way.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This book emerges from a research project, ‘ _Tatau_ /tattoo: Embodied art and cultural exchange’, generously funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Board (2001–5) and the Getty Grant Program (2002–4). The editors and contributors are tremendously appreciative of these bodies’ support for a possibly offbeat project involving participants from Samoa, New Zealand, Japan, Australia, the USA and Britain, and not only cross -disciplinary collaboration, but work between scholarship, curatorial practice, video, photography and tattooing itself. It is important to signal that the project was, in the first instance, stimulated by the practice of the great and controversial Samoan _tufuga ta tatau_ (‘tattooist’), the late Paulo Sulu’ape II, and by Mark Adams’s images of Sulu’ape’s practice and those of related contemporary Samoan _tatau_ artists. While the larger project aimed to contextualize the singular dynamism of contemporary Samoan tattooing through a wider account of Pacific and European exchanges since the eighteenth century – that perforce demanded reflection on what cultural exchange in the domain of body arts entailed and effected – another of the project’s publications, forthcoming from Te Papa Press, presents Adams’s work on Sulu’ape more extensively. Here, we also thank Ashley Vanes and Greg Semu for their permission to include their photographic work, as well as all the many archivists and curators who provided us with access to collections and enabled us to reproduce images. Thanks particularly to Lissant Bolton, Stephen Coppel and Jenny Newell at the British Museum, and Christina Hellmich and Dan Finamore at the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem. Special thanks also to Michael Leaman for his enthusiasm regarding this book.

Nicholas Thomas would like to thank colleagues at Goldsmiths College for their support in hosting the project, especially Anna Cole for her work as co-ordinator. All those involved – Lisa Taouma, Keone Nunes, Unasa Va’a and Karl Broome, as well as those represented in this book – have contributed to an unusually rewarding collaboration. Thanks also to Nigel Rigby of the National Maritime Museum, Sophie Macintyre of the Adam Art Gallery at Victoria University and Zelda Cheatle in London for facilitating linked exhibitions. Special thanks also to Annie Coombes for her critical intellectual stimulus and everything else.

Anna Cole thanks Cassi Plate and Nicholas Thomas for valuable feedback on her draft, and Bronwen Douglas and George Butler for much appreciated support throughout the editorial process. For her quick and helpful picture research many thanks to Jocelyne Dudding, Photograph and Manuscript Collections, Pitt Rivers Museum.

Anne D’Alleva would like to thank the _Tatau_ /Tattoo group, especially Bronwen Douglas, for a challenging and engaging collaboration. In addition, Steven Ball, Shigeyuki Kihara, Thérèse Mangos, Rosanna Raymond and Lisa Taouma all contributed to her better understanding of _tatau_ , Samoa, Tahiti and missionary histories. Father Carlo Maria Schianchi very kindly opened the Marist Archives; the archives staff of the School of Oriental and African Studies were also very helpful. Nicholas Thomas and Anna Cole saw through the writing of this essay, and it is the better for their attentions. Thanks also to the Rinaldi family in Rome and Liam Browne and Piotr Piecha in London for their hospitality; and finally very special thanks to Cathy Bochain, who tended the home fires during the research and writing of this piece.

Elena Govor would like to thank Olga Fedorova, Tamara Shafranovskaia, Makiko Kuwahara and Nicholas Thomas for assistance with access to research materials and to Bronwen Douglas for advice and help in editing her draft.

Sean Mallon would like to thank Su’a Sulu’ape Paulo, Su’a Suluape Petelo, Tauatele Fosi Levi, Sulu’ape Freewind, Sulu’ape Uili Tasi, Sulu’ape Michel Thieme, Mark Adams, Niko Besnier and Vishvajit Pandya, Teresia Teaiwa, Noel McGrevy and the staff of Te Aka Matua Library Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

Peter Brunt thanks Mark Adams, Leonie Brunt, Sean Mallon, his colleagues in Art History at Victoria University of Wellington, Nicholas Thomas and Anna Cole.

Ngahuia Te Awekotuku, Linda Waimarie Nikora and Mohi Rua would like to acknowledge the Marsden Fund, which is the major financial contributor supporting the Ta Moko Project, based at the University of Waikato.
