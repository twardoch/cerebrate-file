## ‘Speckled Bodies’: Russian Voyagers and Nuku Hivans, 1804

Elena Govor

In 1804, during the return journey of the first Russian circumnavigation, the ships _Nadezhda_ and _Neva_ anchored for several weeks in the Bay of Taiohae on Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands. The Russian visitors recorded their observations of the local people in numerous journals and memoirs, while the artists on the expedition produced a remarkable visual corpus, including many drawings of tattooed Marquesans. These accounts and images provide a unique window into early nineteenth-century Pacific island cultures and the cross-cultural encounters that took place during this significant Russian voyage.

The Russian expedition was led by Adam Johann von Krusenstern (Ivan Kruzenshtern) and included a diverse group of participants: officers, sailors, scientists, artists and other specialists. The visual documentation produced during their stay was extensive and detailed, offering insights into Marquesan tattooing practices that had not been fully captured in earlier European accounts.

During their time in Taiohae Bay, the Russians encountered members of what they described as the local royal family, including individuals who were heavily tattooed according to traditional Marquesan practices. The tattoos covered extensive areas of the body and followed specific cultural patterns that were distinct to the Marquesas Islands.

The expedition's artists created detailed studies of these tattooed individuals, producing drawings that showed both full-body compositions and close-up studies of particular tattoo designs. These images revealed the complexity and artistry of Marquesan tattoo work, which differed significantly from the tattooing practices observed in other parts of Polynesia.

The Russian accounts described the tattooing process and the social significance of these body markings within Marquesan culture. Unlike some earlier European observers who focused primarily on the exotic nature of the practice, the Russian visitors showed considerable interest in understanding the cultural context and meaning behind the tattoos they observed.

The expedition's surgeon and naturalists provided medical and ethnographic observations about the tattooing techniques used by the Marquesans, including descriptions of the tools and methods employed. They noted the extensive coverage of the tattoos and the skill with which they were applied, recognizing these as important aspects of local cultural identity.

The Russian encounter with the Nuku Hivans represents one of the more detailed early nineteenth-century observations of Pacific island tattooing practices. Their documentation helps fill gaps in our understanding of how these cultural traditions were maintained and practiced in the Marquesas during this period, and provides valuable comparative material for understanding the diversity of tattooing practices across Polynesia.# CHAPTER TWO

## ‘Speckled Bodies’: Russian Voyagers and Nuku Hivans, 1804

He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow  
Ecclesiastes 1:18

The world of _te patu tiki_ – Marquesan tattoo – has attracted scholars for more than two centuries. After the detailed examination and inventory published by Karl Steinen in the 1920s, the modern ethnological study by Alfred Gell and the most complete recent work by Pierre and Marie-Noelle Ottino-Garanger,[1](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-1) it might be thought that this theme had been explored in full. Nevertheless, my attempt to look more closely at the inception of the rich body of information on tattoo in a particular part of the Marquesas – the island of Nuku Hiva – brought to light unexpected discoveries that in some respects go beyond this limited area and raise a number of more general questions.

The object of my study is the first Russian round-the-world expedition on the sloops _Nadezhda_ and _Neva_, which spent twelve days at Taiohae Bay at Nuku Hiva in May 1804. The accounts by its principal members – the commander and captain of the _Nadezhda_, Adam Krusenstern (Ivan Kruzenshtern in Russian), the captain of the _Neva_, Iury Lisiansky, and the naturalist Georg Langsdorff – translated into Western languages and the visual imagery published in their works belong to the corpus of so-called classical sources about Nuku Hiva.[2](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-2) But numerous materials were not translated: being scattered in Russian periodicals and locked in Soviet archives, they remained almost inaccessible to Western scholars. During a recent research trip to Russia, I was able to copy little-known accounts by Langsdorff, the artist-naturalist Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau (including his original sketchbook), Makar Ratmanov, Fedor Romberg, Fedor Shemelin, Nikolai Rezanov, Nikolai Korobitsyn, Archpriest Gedeon and Vasily Berkh, as well as a Russian translation of the diary of four Japanese men who had been shipwrecked in Russian waters in 1790 and who were being returned to Japan on board the _Nadezhda_. The German manuscript of the voluminous journal of Lieutenant Herman Loewenstern (Ermolai Levenshtern in Russian) has recently been published in Russian translation, while many of his drawings are held by the Estonian Historical Archives.[3](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-3) Langsdorff's original drawings are extant, while Tilesius and Langsdorff also published accounts of the voyage in early nineteenth-century German periodicals. The written and pictorial accounts of over a dozen members of the expedition have been brought together here for the first time, including works by at least three artists – Tilesius, Langsdorff and Loewenstern.

None of the other early voyages to the Pacific, including Cook's, produced such numerous and diverse accounts. My research so far has not only brought to light new material but permits the juxtaposition of different genres, each of which enhances the others. My textual analysis of the English versions of the classical accounts by Krusenstern, Langsdorff and Lisiansky in tandem with their Russian/German originals helped eliminate numerous misreadings in translations. The process raises the general problem of the contingency of the early texts that are used for ethno-historical reconstructions, but this chapter deals mainly with pictorial representations, including the portraits of several well-known personalities, most of whom are depicted with more or less elaborate tattoo.

Tilesius made the important remark that he 'had drawn portraits of . . . the members of the king's family'.[4](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-4) Indeed, the selection of people whom the Russians drew and the way they were represented did not occur by chance. Plate xv in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ entitled 'Depiction of the faces of Nuka Hivans' is an engraved collective portrait of 'King Ketenue's court', where each person occupies a corresponding position (illus. 30). This 'court' at the time of the Russian visit was not numerous. It included about a dozen close family members to whom the visitors constantly referred and who became the models for their drawings. In total, the three Russian artists produced detailed drawings of more than 20 individuals, whom I try here to identify with particular named persons.

The central figure in the Russians' interactions with the Nuku Hivans was 'king' Keatonui, called 'Ketenue' by the Russians. He was described by many voyagers, including the London Missionary Society missionary William Pascoe Crook, the beachcomber Edward Robarts, and the US Navy captain David Porter, but no particular visual imagery has previously been associated with him. Russian visitors broke the ground in this respect. Tilesius' drawing of the 'king' in his sketchbook,[5](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-5) inscribed 'Kettenue', uses classical conventions to an anthropological end – to represent a typical member of a particular ethnic group rather than an individual personality (illus. 31). The drawing was engraved in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ as the central figure in the upper row of plate xv (illus. 30). The engraver, I. S. Klauber, added tattoo designs to the shoulder that were lacking in Tilesius' drawing but which presumably were meant to contribute to the solemnity of the 'king'. The most interesting representation of Keatonui is the full-length portrait drawn by Loewenstern (illus. 32). Not an artist by profession, he nevertheless managed to catch the individuality of this important man. The solemn, imposing, slightly corpulent, probably late middle-aged man depicted in the act of presenting a kava plant (_piper methysticum_) is certainly more than a curiously decorated savage. Although naked, he seems to be richly dressed – in tattoos. The picture refers to the particular moment when Keatonui visited the _Nadezhda_ for the first time. Lieutenant Romberg briefly remarked in a letter to his friends: 'The naked king with a sapling in his hand made a visit to us'.[6](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-6) Tilesius provided further details:

a big pirogue pulled up to our ship. There was an exceptionally corpulent and completely tattooed man with a thick neck standing at the front. His body was of dark-blue colour. This fat man was called the king of the valley . . . His name is Kettenue, Tapega. The latter is his title which means right hand. In the right hand he was carrying a pepper plant, from which an intoxicating drink is made, signifying by this peace and friendship.[7](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-7)

Shemelin, the supercargo on the voyage, wrote about Keatonui with respect, sympathy and some humour. Shemelin was not shocked by the naked tattooed body of 'the king', but the density of his tattoos so darkened his skin as to remind Shemelin of an African – a common analogy in the early literature on Polynesian tattoo (see Douglas, this volume):

The king seemed to be over fifty already, he was stately and of a large stature. Unlike his retinue, bold and talkative, he was distinguished by modesty and reticence which imparted him a spirit of some dignity . . .

His questions about the things around him were brief, his answers even briefer. . . . The things which he saw probably for the first time in his life had little effect on his curiosity. He preferred to all practical things he saw a big mirror in the Captain's cabin, to which he came up with a joyful air and looked at himself in it from top to bottom, outstretching hands, bending to all sides, turning to it with his sides and back and seemed to admire with delight his patterned skin which was all speckled with circles, ovals, wide and narrow strips and lattices so thickly that there was not even a nail sized spot clear of black dots left on his body, so that the King under his foppish dress seemed to be a true native of Angola.[8](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-8)

Loewenstern, who referred to Keatonui's tattooed skin as 'dark-blue, nearly black',[9](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-9) managed to convey this impression in his drawing, in which, however, the details of the tattoos on the face are indistinguishable and schematic. Tilesius, on the contrary, attempted to trace the pattern of the tattoo in his drawing of Keatonui's head.

There is tantalizing information about one more portrait of Keatonui done by the artist of the expedition Stepan Kurliandtsev, a Russian portraitist. It surfaced in the documents of the Academy of Fine Arts in St Petersburg at least twice. In 1818 Kurliandtsev applied for financial assistance, referring to his work on the portrait of 'Katenue, king of Taiogai'. In the following year he submitted the painting as a gift to the tsar, Alexander I. The officials considered that it was 'rather weak' and returned it to Kurliandtsev. Its further destiny, as well as that of his entire pictorial legacy, remains unknown.[10](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-10)

Tilesius made at least two portraits of Keatonui's 'brothers'. One drawing in his sketchbook is entitled 'Pienui der Bruder des Königes Kettenue' (illus. 33) and another simply 'Tamatoi' (illus. 31).[11](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-11) The engraver reworked head and neck drawings by Tilesius into upper bust engravings and added chest shields. Aligned alongside Keatonui in plate xv of Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ (illus. 30), they resemble him somewhat in tattoo style and facial traits. 'Tama toi' was most likely Keatonui's youngest brother recorded by the missionary Crook as 'Tamati'. Loewenstern recorded in his journal that 'Tama tai, his [the "king's"] brother, has the name of an enemy he killed'.[12](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-12) As for 'Pienui', it is hard to say with certainty which of Keatonui's nine brothers he might have been, but it is likely that the 'king's brother' mentioned by nearly all the Russian voyagers was he. Analysis of the Russian accounts suggests also that he ranked next to Keatonui in importance. 'The king's brother' (never 'a brother') was the first visitor to the _Nadezhda_ when it had just moored. He visited the ship soon afterwards in Keatonui's retinue but only he and Keatonui himself were singled out to be entertained with tea in the captain's cabin. Rezanov, the envoy extraordinary aboard the _Nadezhda_, commented that they were tattooed more than the others and, according to Rezanov and Shemelin, the gifts the brother received were nearly equal to those given to the 'king'.[13](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-13) 'The king's brother' accompanied Keatonui during their visit to the _Neva_, where he bartered a pig and a piglet for a duck and a drake. The priest Gedeon explained that they hoped that the duck would have offspring with red feathers.[14](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-14) Red feathers were prestigious items in the Marquesas, and probably the brothers made the association with the Brazilian red parrots that had fascinated them on the _Nadezhda_. Lisiansky remarked that on the way to Keatonui's residence they had a break to rest at his brother's house. Finally, he mentioned that 'the brother of the king of Tayohaia married the daughter' of the neighbouring chief to the west and that this union had stopped warfare between the two districts.[15](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-15)

The upper row of plate xv in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ depicts a profile portrait of a man who seemingly broke the mould of Keatonui's relatives by virtue of his curly hair without 'horns' (illus. 30). The inscription over this portrait in Tilesius's sketchbook reads 'Taputakaya Mufäu' (illus. 34). Langsdorff referred to him as 'Mau-ka-u, or Mufau Taputa kava', others as 'Muhau', 'Maugau', 'Mugau'. All the participants in the expedition admired 'his extraordinary height, the vast strength of his body, and the admirable proportion of his limbs and muscles'. Tilesius measured every part of his body and sent the details to the great German comparative anatomist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in Göttingen. Blumenbach 'compared these proportions with the Apollo of Belvedere, and found that those of that masterpiece of the finest ages of Grecian art, in which is combined every possible integer in the composition of manly beauty, corresponded exactly with our Mufau, an inhabitant of the island of Nukahiwa'.[16](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-16) Independently of the savants, who were mostly Germanic in origin, Shemelin, an ethnic Russian who went on an excursion around the island with 'Mugau', wrote: 'His limbs were so well proportioned that sculpture and art depicting human perfection would never find a better example than this Nuahivan Hercules'.[17](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-17)

Unsurprisingly, the voyagers' pictorial representations of 'Mufau' were not limited to Tilesius' drawing. I believe that the famous coloured engraving of the 'Man from Nuku Hiva Island' depicted with a club, _u'u_, on his right shoulder and a gourd in his left hand in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ is also a portrait of Mufau (illus. 35). Krusenshtern wrote in the Russian edition of his _Voyage_ that Mufau was the 'handsomest men that ever existed' and that 'The attached drawing would represent more clearly his gigantic, perfectly built body'.[18](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-18) Versions of this engraving illustrate both the German and English editions of Krusenshtern's _Voyage_, while it is the only full-length detailed portrait of a Nuku Hivan in the Russian _Atlas_. There is no original full-length drawing of Mufau in Tilesius' sketchbook, although there is a sketch of a man's head wearing a headdress made from pig's teeth similar to that in the engraving of Mufau. This face is depicted with no tattoo at all, probably because the artist was in this instance more concerned to show the man's ornamentation and facial expression.[19](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-19) A coloured drawing presumably of Mufau by Tilesius was preserved among Blumenbach's papers in Göttingen (illus. 36).[20](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-20) Here Mufau holds the same club in his right hand while his outstretched left hand grasps the outline of a vertical spear. It is probable that Tilesius sent this drawing to Blumenbach in connection with his account of Mufau's figure. The meticulously prepared coloured engraving of Mufau in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ by Egor Skotnikov and Klauber became canonical. The engraving by J. A. Atkinson in the English edition of Krusenshtern's _Voyage_ is poorer and more schematic. It simplifies many details of the tattoo, especially on the torso. The differences between the Göttingen coloured drawing and the engraving in the _Atlas_ are more important – the tattoos, though uniform in general, have numerous divergences, especially in the middle and lower part of the torso, which cannot be explained by simplification, as in Atkinson's variant, but most likely resulted from the engravers' exercise of artistic licence. Moreover, Tilesius' drawing of Mufau's head is quite different from the full-length representations. Thus, despite this rich iconography of a particular person, it is impossible to say which, if any, of the representations corresponded most closely to past actuality. In principle, however, greater verisimilitude is to be assumed in an artist's field sketches and then in his reworked drawings than in engravings.

It was not by chance that Mufau was depicted among the members of Keatonui's family. The visitors learned that he was the 'firemaker at the king's', that is, the queen's _pekio_, 'secondary husband'. At the same time Krusenshtern remarked several times on Mufau's glory as 'the strongest and most intrepid' warrior.[21](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-21) At the end of the eighteenth century, according to Crook, 'the chief's Pekkeyo' was 'Paienue' (Peueinui), a member of the _tapu_, 'restricted', 'forbidden', class who owned large properties; he was also _toa_, 'head warrior', in the Tei'i tribe. As Nicholas Thomas argued, however,

Crook . . . noted that a _pekio_ came to 'belong' as much to the husband, or the husband's part of the family, as to the wife and the wife's, and this perhaps explains why Peueinui was spoken of as Keatonui's _pekio_. The roles of chief and head warrior were sometimes shared by the same individual, which perhaps explains why the ornaments which Peueinui wore into battle actually belonged to Keatonui. . . . It was exceptional for a prominent man such as a head warrior to act as a _pekio_.[22](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-22)

It is therefore tempting to identify 'Mufau Taputa-kava' with Peueinui because Mufau, according to the Russians, combined the duties of _pekio_ with a prominent position in Keatonui's household and was an outstanding warrior (the Russians did not record the word _toa_). The only contradictory detail is Langsdorff's impression that Mufau was 20 years old in 1804 – thus it is doubtful that he could have been _toa_ in 1798 during Crook's visit – although Shemelin was less definite, referring to him as 'a young islander', and Loewenstern called him 'a big lad'.[23](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-23) Moreover, the fact that his intricate tattoo seems to have been complete at the time of the Russians' visit suggests that he must by then have been older than 20.

Finally, among the depictions of the important male members of Keatonui's family is a full-face head, shoulders and chest portrait – the sixth man in the upper row of plate XV in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ (illus. 30). The original drawing by Tilesius in his sketchbook has the inscription 'Omau Dei der Neffe des Königes aus Hikahiwa' (that is, the king's nephew) (illus. 33). I identify him as Mouwateie, the husband of Keatonui's daughter Tahatapu and the son of the chief of Hapa'a valley, rather than as a nephew of the 'king'. Tilesius said of him: 'the king's nephew, of whom, as well as of other members of the King's family, I have drawn a portrait, was always dressed in a bast mat instead of cloth'. Krusenshtern seems to have written about the same man: 'Mats are sometimes used among them, and the king's son-in-law, though he indeed was the only person, always came to the ship in one of a very coarse kind'.[24](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-24) He added:

fortunate union has set the inhabitants of Tayo Hoae at peace with those of another valley in the interior, the king of which is called Mau-day ['MauDei' in the Russian original], (signifying head of the warriors) . . . He married the daughter of Kettenowee, and as no naval war can be carried on between them, they live in a state of perfect peace. Mau-day was almost always in Tayo Hoae, and after Mau-ha-u and Bauting was the handsomest man we saw; he was likewise one of our daily guests.[25](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-25)

Fortunately, the iconography of Mouwateie is not limited to Tilesius' drawing and the engraving based on it. I believe that this 'handsome' man was the model for Langsdorff's full-length portrait published in his _Voyages_ as 'An Inhabitant of the Island of Nukahiwa' – this is one of the most celebrated of all portraits of tattooed Nuku Hivans (illus. 37). Langsdorff commented that it was:

engraved from designs made upon the spot, that the most accurate idea possible might be given of so singular an art. The portrait here delineated is of a man about thirty years of age, a period at which the figures formed by the punctures appear the most distinctly. In later years, one figure is made over another, till the whole becomes confused, and the body assumes a Negro-like appearance, as may be observed in the stripe across the belly.[26](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-26)

Loewenstern also made two full-length drawings that I identify as Mouwateie. In one, he is holding a spear and in the other he is preparing to throw it (illus. 38 and 39). And finally Tilesius created a new drawing of a seated Mouwateie which was engraved for his publication in the _Allgemeine Musikalsche Zeitung_ in 1805. The coloured engraving is at the National Library of Australia (illus. 40). Later Tilesius wrote that the Islander depicted was 'Omaudei, nephew of king Kettenue'.[27](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-27)

These five portraits of one man made by three artists who were simultaneously in the field depict a number of crucial elements of his tattoo in similar fashion: the shield on the chest with two ovals on the sides; similar ovals on the shoulders; the 'necklace'; the thickly tattooed 'neck-collar' with an opening at the front; and the line across the nose evolving into a darkened segment on the lower left part of the face. Langsdorff's and Loewenstern's drawings are also similar in the composition of the torso and leg decorations. But a precise look at the tattoo elements reveals numerous discrepancies. For instance, the shape and contents of the chest shield change from picture to picture; the content of the ovals also changes; one 'necklace' triples (even in different drawings by the same artist). The black eye that is present in four drawings is absent from the most detailed bust portrait by Tilesius. At the same time, only the latter portrait has an unusual sign resembling an anchor in a semicircle on the forehead. The engraving of 'Omaudei' illustrating Tilesius' German article is the most controversial. The text targeted a broad readership and was sprinkled with exotic tales, while the motifs depicted in the engraving are a concoction of fantasies, particularly the spirals and concentric circles on the torso. This engraving diverges dramatically from Tilesius' original sketch of 'Omau Dei'.

This abundant and varied iconography of one man is a rare case in the history of early representations of Polynesian tattoo. Similar to the case of Mufau, each of these portraits taken in isolation seems reliable. But juxtaposition of different media and different artists' or engravers' impressions of the same person raises serious doubts about the precision of the tattoo motifs depicted. Later researchers have uncritically taken for granted the accuracy of tattoo elements reproduced in the best known of the engravings – Tilesius's 'Omaudei' and Langsdorff's 'An Inhabitant of the Island of Nukahiwa' (illus. 40 and 37) – and have painstakingly analysed them as exact images of 'traditional' tattoo.[28](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-28) At most, however, such representations can be taken as approximate variations on a theme and one can only surmise which, if any, is the most naturalistic. This is indeed an instance of the biblical maxim 'He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow' – or at least uncertainty. It raises serious theoretical questions about the validity of overly literal interpretation of the detail depicted in representations of Polynesian tattoo produced in the pre-photographic era.

Finally, I consider portraits of Marquesan women made by the Russian artists and speculate on who might have been their prototypes. Tilesius' sketchbook contains four fine gouaches of women. The first is 'Ukea Wahini Nuku Hivan aristocrat', drawn with her head and breast draped in cloth (illus. 41). This portrait was later engraved with tattooed lips in plate xv of Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ (illus. 30). The second is 'Nuku Hivan with Palm Branch', depicted with the tattooed inner side of the wrist (illus. 42). The third is 'Titkia Wobusi Nuku Hivan girl in ball attire', shown without tattoo.[29](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-29) The final portrait is 'Woman in Yellow Cloth' drawn with tattooed hand and wrist (illus. 43). This watercolour became an engraving in Kruzenshtern's _Atlas_ with tattoo added to the lips (illus. 44).

Tilesius's focus on depicting the principal members of Keatonui's family permits us to surmise that these drawings also represented close relatives of the 'king'. Keatonui's wife, Teheatioa, can be excluded, since the elaborate tattoo on her hand elsewhere copied by Langsdorff did not coincide at all with the wrist tattoos shown in the four portraits.[30](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-30) Moreover, according to the anecdotal evidence of an anonymous man from the _Neva_, 'she was around forty, and all her attractive charms had deserted her already'.[31](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-31) Keatonui's daughter and daughter-in-law seem more likely models for these watercolours. Krusenstern said about them:

The king's daughter, a young woman of about twenty-four years of age, and his daughter-in-law, who seemed a few years younger, were both of a remarkably good appearance, which even in Europe would not have been denied. . . . Their bodies . . . were neither coloured nor tatooed; but half of the arm and hand was tatooed black and yellow, which gave them the appearance of short gloves, such as our ladies used formerly to wear.[32](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-32)

The daughter was probably Tahatapu, the wife of Mouwateie, who lived at the time of the Russian visit in Keatonui's household and was the subject of drawings by Tilesius and others. More mysterious is the identity of the daughter-in-law, who was mentioned by several of the Russians. According to Krusenstern, Keatonui's son was 'married to the daughter of the king of the Taipihs' (Taipi) and she was brought to Taiohae by sea, thereby stopping sea warfare between the two tribes. Lisiansky added: 'The handsomest of my party was certainly the Goddess, whose name was Anataena. She was a daughter of the king of another bay in the island, called Houmé, and owed her title of divinity to her marriage'.[33](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-33) According to the anonymous Russian, when visiting the _Neva_ she and Keatonui's daughter 'were taken away by the officers to their cabins where they with special delight gave themselves to their will', while '"the Queen" was outraged that she was not given such a private audience being too old'.[34](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-34) Moreover, there are grounds to believe that 'the Goddess' was Lisiansky's choice. Lisiansky's 'Anataena' must have been Henateiane of Ho'oumi, the wife of Keatonui's eldest son, Duetowa. She was described by Crook as a middle-aged woman with numerous _pekios_. Either she was still very attractive in 1804, six years after Crook's visit, or Crook overestimated her age. I conclude that Tilesius' solemn-looking 'Nuka Hivan aristocrat' was Tahatapu, Keatonui's daughter, and that his 'Woman in yellow cloth' was inspired by Henateiane. In both the drawing and the engraving based on it, Henateiane is depicted as playful and attractive, though with a slight double chin, perhaps denoting that she was no longer young. Interestingly, the drawing and the engraving differ significantly in their depiction of her arm and hand tattoo. The less elaborate pattern shown in the drawing is presumably more naturalistic, while more intricate elements were probably added to the engraving as ethnographic information.

This novel capacity to identify the rich portrait iconography of the first Russian expedition to Nuku Hiva with historical personages who resided in the Taiohae, Hapa'a and Ho'oumi valleys and whose genealogies are well known is an important breakthrough in the ethno-historical exploration of Marquesan tattoo and society generally. It permits a more detailed and informed examination of tattoo designs from particular family, social and territorial settings. At the same time, the analysis of discrepancies between different portraits of the same person in a variety of genres permits some discrimination between more and less naturalistic representations of tattoo patterns.

Shifting emphasis from visual to written representations of tattooed Marquesans, Russian textual accounts again suggest that different observers saw the same things differently. With respect to perceptions, the episode of the first encounter is telling. Entering Taiohae Bay, the _Nadezhda_ sent two yawls forward. They were approached by a canoe apparently crewed by 'natives', one of whom came aboard the yawl and returned to the ship. That 'native' was Edward Robarts, an English beach-comber, who described himself at that moment:

They took me out of the canoe into the boat. The officer gave me a bit of red cloth, a few fish hooks & some nails, he thinking I was a native. This diverted me, nor did I undeceive them untill after I got on board. My beard was very long; it coverd my breast, for I had not been shaved for about 3 years. My skin [was] tanned with the sun. No one on board thought but that I was a native.[35](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-35)

It was his beard and the colour of his skin, he believed, that deceived the visitors. But other features struck the observers more forcefully. Shemelin wrote in his journal: 'The Lieutenant [Golovachev] reaching the ship introduced the savage to the Captain. We all looked at the newcomer, who was speckled over his body by brownish-blue geometrical figures, perpendicular and slanting lines and strips, triangles, quadrangles with different patterns inside, spots and lattices'.[36](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-36) Several others reported similar impressions: 'The boat came alongside the ship; all the natives were naked and speckled with patterns, and one of them, entering the ship, surprised us even more when he started to speak English' (Rezanov); 'We were very surprised when we saw among the natives a naked and tattooed Englishman' (Loewenstern); 'He was almost entirely naked, having only a narrow girdle tied round his middle, and was tatooed on the breast' (Espenberg).[37](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-37) Tilesius remembered another feature: Robarts kept his letter of introduction from an English captain 'tied with two knots in his hair as is customary among the natives'. In his earliest published account, Tilesius described him as 'a man of medium stature, not painted [i.e., not tattooed], though his hair was dressed the same as the natives, naked with a loincloth in front'.[38](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-38) What is remarkable in these accounts is the discrepancy concerning Robarts's tattoo. Moreover, in describing this encounter Krusenshtern, Langsdorff and Ratmanov did not mention his tattoo at all, while the Japanese on board the ship referred to Robarts and Cabri, a French beachcomber, as 'two fair-haired men completely different from the natives'.[39](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-39) These discrepancies exemplify the well-known phenomenon that eyewitness testimonies of the same event can vary wildly, especially when people confront the unusual in an agitated state of mind.

Even later, when the excitement of the first meeting had subsided and more dispassionate observation might have been expected, the two most reliable observers – Langsdorff and Tilesius – produced very different accounts of Robarts's tattoo. According to Langsdorff's well-known voyage narrative, Robarts 'had only a puncture on his breast, in the form of a long square, six inches one way and four the other', the sign of belonging to Keatonui's retinue.[40](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-40) In a much later work of natural history published in Russian, Tilesius described Robarts in terms sharply at odds both with Langsdorff's narrative and his own early published ethnography. By this account, Robarts had a fish tattooed on his body together with the 'figure of a heart pierced by an arrow, which he ordered to be done by the day of his marriage'. Otherwise, apart from the fish, he 'had no other usual Nukahivan decorations, which covered the whole body of the Frenchman [Cabri]'.[41](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-41) This example, as with that of the five different portraits of Mowateie discussed above, demonstrates the instability of voyagers' testimonies, both written and pictorial.

Surrounded by tattooed people, the Russians reflected widely on this custom in their accounts. A few well-educated members of the expedition, acquainted with earlier travellers' accounts, were prepared for the encounter with 'speckled bodies', but for many it was something new. Lisiansky admitted: 'This custom seemed strange to me at first, but finally familiarity overcame prejudice and the motley bodies of the islanders seemed very beautiful to me'.[42](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-42) Indeed, the word 'beautiful' recurs in Russian accounts. 'The natives have remarkably beautiful tattoo', Loewenstern recorded in his diary after the first encounter.[43](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-43) Russian textual accounts, which I do not discuss here in detail, supplement the iconography and indicate their general impressions as well as contributing valuable remarks on tattoo designs. They particularly commented on differences in tattoo depending on gender, age and social status and on the actual procedure of tattooing.

Finding themselves in a society where tattooing was one of the most important personal attributes, the Russian voyagers were tempted to try it themselves. Russian sailors, unlike British, French and American ones, had not yet been seduced by this relatively new fashion due to the general isolation of Russia. The word tattoo itself was still almost unknown in Russia. Reading their accounts, we can literally witness the inception of this novel practice among them.

On the third day after the Russian arrival, Loewenstern recorded in his journal: 'Today I had a tattoo done on my arm. The natives are very artful in this business.' Three days later he remarked: 'Tattooing becomes more and more popular on our ship. The native works from morning till night. Even Krusenshtern had a tattoo done.'[44](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-44) Krusenshtern, though not commenting directly about his own experience, wrote in his narrative: 'There are some great masters in this craft among Nuku Hivans. One of them, being aboard the ship during all our stay here, found a lot of employment for himself, as almost all the men invited him to have a pattern done in accordance with his art'.[45](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-45) Tilesius wrote in 1806: 'One of the artists often visited our ship and nearly all sailors and even some of our officers and travellers had different figures made on them'.[46](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-46) Langsdorff wrote that 'this new experience enthralled' nearly everyone on board.[47](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-47) Ratmanov's journal was especially detailed:

Many of our officers and men had small figures tattooed on their hands and arms. The captain had an inscription done on his arm: Jllie [Julie] – the name of his wife whom he adores. I had the inscription done in a semicircle over the left breast above the heart: 'Je suis à vous' – 'I am yours'. All officers felt pain. But I, having given my heart to you, my angel, was so excited making this sacrifice to you in this remote and savage part of the world, my darling, that I did not feel pain and felt that underneath the trembling heart says: 'Yes, I really belong to her'.[48](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-48)

Such conventional inscriptions comprised a significant proportion of the designs. Tilesius added that the tattooist would copy words written for him in Russian and Roman characters.[49](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-49) Obviously, the use of textual inscriptions to express emotional attachments was a usual procedure for the Russians, although presumably not in the form of tattooing.

At the same time, there is evidence that the variety of tattooed designs was not limited to such inscriptions. Ratmanov wrote about 'small figures', Krusenshtern about 'patterns done in accordance with' natives' art'.[50](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-50) Tilesius, observing the tattooists' work aboard the ship, recorded: 'I even saw often that he, without any pattern, just out of his head, would punctuate figures known to him'.[51](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-51) Langsdorff mentioned that the visitors 'would have tattooed a bracelet, a name or a figure as a memento'. He himself, according to Tilesius, had tattooed on his arm a figure called 'Te ioe hinenau' (_te a'ahinea'o_), a love symbol, which Langsdorff described ethnographically as a 'sign of wishing to be loved'.[52](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-52) These remarks suggest that indigenous Nuku Hivan patterns were also favoured.

Especially interesting in this respect is the story of Count Fedor Ivanovich Tolstoy, a first cousin once removed of the great novelist Leo Tolstoy, who characterized him as 'an extraordinary personality, immoral and attractive'. Fedor Tolstoy was well known among the Russian aristocracy, being a hero, sometimes a negative hero, of numerous works by Russian poets and writers including Pushkin, Griboedov and Leo Tolstoy himself. While serving in the army, he was famous for his 'wild existence of drinking, gambling, womanising and extravagant exploits of every sort'.[53](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-53) Being one of the most celebrated Russian duellists, he used the opportunity to join Krusenshtern's expedition to flee troubles stemming from a duel with his commanding officer. Incidentally, he was taken aboard instead of another Tolstoy – Fedor Petrovich – who later became a famous painter. Nevertheless, Tolstoy also brought an artwork back from the expedition – his own body tattooed all over, for reasons about which one can only speculate. Leo Tolstoy, who knew the count and even wanted to write a book about him, wrote in 1865 of 'that Tolstoyan wildness that's common to us all. Not for nothing did Fedor Ivanovich have himself tattooed'.[54](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-54)

Having been left at Kamchatka because of a confrontation with Krusenshtern, Tolstoy had many adventures in the north Pacific region. According to numerous anecdotes, he was for some time a 'king' of the Tlingits of south-eastern Alaska, but finally he chose to return to Russia via Siberia. The Tolstoy family history records that 'In the province of Kazan his arrival was recorded by an eyewitness, who recalled his amazement at encountering the wild figure, tattooed from head to foot and dressed in the weather-stained uniform of the Preobrazhensky Guards, in which apparently he had led the Tlinkits on their walrus-hunts'.[55](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-55) Tolstoy's tales about his northern experience earned him the title 'Tolstoy the American', but, since I have found no documentary evidence of his actual stay with native Americans, I speculate that part at least of his intricate tattoo might well have been done by a Nuku Hivan artist.

On reaching St Petersburg, he was apt to display his newly decorated body, which presumably had a significant impact in awakening public interest to tattooing. His niece, Maria Kamenskaia, remembered one such exhibition:

He undid his shirt-studs, and bared and swelled out his chest. Everyone at the table stood up in their places and gazed attentively at it: it was completely covered in tattoos. In the very middle sat in a ring some sort of big multi-coloured bird, rather like a parrot, in a red and blue hoop . . . both arms were likewise completely tattooed, with snakes and other wild designs entwined around them. The ladies sighed and gasped without ceasing, and asked solicitously: 'Wasn't it very painful, Count, when those savages tattooed you? How did they pick out the designs? Oh, what suffering!'.[56](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-56)

This account is interesting because Kamenskaia might have misinterpreted the actual images tattooed on Tolstoy's body. It is unfair to expect an accurate account of an extensive body tattoo from a person overwhelmed by the sensory experience of seeing it for the first time. We have already seen this in the case of Robarts's tattoo.

But tattooing did indeed start to capture public imagination. Another 'promoter' of tattoo in Russia was the French beachcomber Jean-Baptiste Cabri, who left Nuku Hiva with Krusenshtern's expedition; he had indigenous Marquesan tattoos all over his body. According to Langsdorff,

The extraordinary fate of this man, and the novel appearance of his tattooed body, attracted the attention of every one. Both at Moscow and at St Petersburg he exhibited upon the stage the dances of the savages, and was considered by all the great people of the country as a real curiosity.

Finally, 'his dexterity in swimming, in which he is scarcely excelled by the natives of Nuka Hiwa themselves, has procured him the appointment of teacher of swimming to the corps of marine cadets at Cronstadt'.[57](19_Reference.xhtml#ref2-57) Presumably his tattoos stirred the imagination of aristocrats and young cadets alike. Furthermore, during the nineteenth century tattoo also became an almost universal fashion among Russian seamen, in spite of their relative isolation from the Western open markets for seamen's labour.

This study enables the attribution of celebrated images of Nuku Hivans to particular artists and brings to light a number of unknown portraits. The juxtaposition of different images with each other and with textual accounts helps to establish genealogies of the visual representations and to identify some of their subjects with known historical personages, thus opening a field for further ethno-historical explorations. Comparative analysis of the textual material contributes complementary information: on tattooing itself, on the ways in which it was perceived by the Russian visitors, and on the tattoo mania that seized them in Nuku Hiva, together with its metropolitan aftermath.

# CHAPTER THREE

## Marks of Transgression: The Tattooing of Europeans in the Pacific Islands

Joanna White

During James Cook's third and final voyage to the Pacific, John Ledyard, corporal of the marines on board the _Resolution_, described in his journal a relationship that was struck up between a sailor and a Maori woman during the ships' sojourn in New Zealand. According to Ledyard's version of events, the visiting seaman elected to become tattooed in full conformity with indigenous tradition:

though our sailor appeared amiable in her eyes in the habit of a stranger he was conscious that to ornament his person in the fashion of New Zealand would still recommend him more to his mistress and the country he was in; he therefore submitted himself to be tatowed from head to foot.[1](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-1)

Although Ledyard might have slightly romanticized the scenario,[2](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-2) this account is striking since it demonstrates how elaborate, indigenous forms of tattooing were readily adopted by Europeans at such an early point in the history of their contact with Pacific peoples. Such engagement with the local practice is closely identified with gaining acceptance among Islanders (in this particular case the sailor's adoption of Maori tattooing formed part of a wider strategy for incorporation within the local community, since he later attempted to desert from his ship and take up local residence). Furthermore, this account illustrates how tattooing can be understood as not merely an individual enterprise, but a mutual constitution of human agency and social environment.[3](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-3) The practice can be understood as a product of many factors, including personal and collective relationships, events, obligations and the prevailing social context.[4](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-4)

This chapter will examine the various processes that resulted in some of the Europeans (and later, Americans) who visited the Pacific in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries electing to become tattooed as a result of their contact with indigenous peoples. By exploring the diverse motivations that led to individuals irreversibly transforming their bodies, the motifs they chose to have inscribed, and the meaning(s) that this process and its outcome held for them, new insight can be gained into the role of tattooing in both shaping and communicating personal and social identities. The ways in which tattooing was perceived in different cultural contexts and the impact of Pacific encounters on European tattooing traditions during this period will also be discussed.

Although encounters between explorers, sailors and Pacific Islanders in the late eighteenth century are still popularly understood to have made a significant contribution to modern Western tattooing, recent studies have suggested that exposure to Pacific body modification conventions may have resulted in the reinvigoration of a long-standing, though historically inconsistent, tradition rather than constituting the origins of the practice in Europe.[5](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-5) It is now broadly accepted that British sailors were already engaging in voluntary[6](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-6) tattooing in the second half of the eighteenth century, although evidence of this practice remains sparse. Records from the Marine Society and 'description books' used to identify employees in London shipyards just after the middle of the eighteenth century, for example, reported occasional cases of boys and men 'mark'd' with their initials or names on their hand, wrist or arm.[7](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-7) The relative scarcity of such references – among copious records – indicates that this practice was not widespread, and was likely to have been customary only among a minority of sailors and those with associations with the sea-faring world, rather than belonging to a linear tradition.

The excitement stimulated among Europeans when they first encountered Pacific tattooing is apparent from the elaborate descriptions of the aesthetic content, visual effects and the technical methods of tattooing reported in contemporary accounts, as well as Sydney Parkinson's striking drawings of this practice, which were produced during Cook's first voyage. The publication of these works ensured that knowledge of Pacific tattooing spread swiftly among the literate classes of Europe.[8](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-8) Yet the place of tattooing within indigenous cosmologies and its importance as a socializing and empowering process, expressive of adulthood, status and group membership (in ways that differed across location), was grasped only partially during this early stage of contact. What travellers were unwittingly exposed to during their voyages to the Pacific was not merely a prolific and sophisticated form of body modification, but tattooing as an _institution_, a prescribed practice that performed a specific, historical function in the maintenance and reproduction of local social systems.

Despite their limited understanding of the local significance of tattooing, however, European interest in Oceanic body modification practices extended beyond mere observation; practical engagement was almost immediate. From Cook's first voyage onwards, there is evidence that visitors to the Pacific Islands became tattooed as a direct result of their contact with indigenous peoples, although, as will be elaborated below, early voyagers, sailors and those who were resident in Pacific societies for prolonged periods engaged with local tattooing traditions in quite distinct ways. Indeed, the various forms in which Europeans adopted the body modification methods they observed in the Pacific expose the heterogeneous nature of the cross-cultural exchange that took place during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as well as the varying appeal that tattooing held for different individuals.

Journals from the period revealed how, for the gentlemen professionals and some of the sailors who travelled on board ships to the Pacific, the experience of being tattooed was a novel activity, engaged in out of curiosity. The indigenous tattooing motifs that were chosen to be marked on the skin served both as permanent, ornamental souvenirs of voyaging and evidence of encounters with Pacific peoples.[9](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-9) Frederick Bennett, a surgeon on board a whaling ship in the 1830s, for example, described visiting Raiatea, one of the Society Islands,

while at this island, I gratified a wish to observe the process and effects of the tatoo by having a figure thus impressed upon myself. The artist I engaged was a Tahitian; and from the numerous patterns displayed on his person we selected a circular figure, named _pote_; the spot I preferred devoting to the impression was the upper arm.[10](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-10)

Early encounters in Tahiti in the second half of the eighteenth century appear to have had a different impact on many sailors, however. Seamen often employed local tattooists not only to inscribe their skin with local motifs, but to mark initials, names and dates on the hand or the arm.[11](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-11) Hence, encounters with Pacific tattooing did not necessarily result in the desire to replicate indigenous styles; instead local expertise was rapidly applied to the reproduction of an existing practice, which, as described earlier, would have been familiar to some sailors, that of marking familiar personal references on one's body. Such forms of tattooing became a convention among sailors that persisted well into the nineteenth century. Indeed, the tattooing of initials during this period has been described as the equivalent of dog tags, providing a means of identification and thereby offering insurance against an anonymous burial, a particular risk for mobile populations such as sailors, who might be lost in a shipwreck or die in a foreign country.[12](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-12)

There is also evidence, however, that exposure to tattooing practices in the Pacific Islands contributed to sailors' understanding of the potential for tattoos to express collective relationships, which led to their imitation of this practice. This is revealed in the account of John Elliott, a midshipman on the _Resolution_ during Cook's second voyage. Elliott reported in his journal how observation of the elite group _arioi_ in Borabora in the Society Islands inspired him and his messmates to adopt the same motif, which distinguished _arioi_ from other Islanders:[13](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-13)

all our Mess conceived the idea of having some mark put on ourselves, as connecting us together, as well as to commemorate our having been at Otaheite. For which purpose we determined on having a compleat Star drawn and then tattowed with black, the same way as the Natives are tat-towed, upon our left Breast, and painful as this operation was, we all underwent it, and have each a very handsome Black Star on our left Breast, the size of a Crown Piece.[14](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-14)

Here the design adopted was multi-referential, serving as a souvenir of the sailors' voyage, as well as a permanent symbol of an exclusive relationship between the men, in this case identification with one's mess – often sailors would be messmates for many years.[15](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-15) The dual expressive potential of tattooing, to mark both personal experiences and social ties, clearly appealed, resulting in an indigenous collective practice being appropriated and transformed through its adoption within a new social milieu.

Later in his account Elliott revealed how, as a result of the tattooed messmates being observed bathing by other members of the crew, the trend 'spread halfway through the ship'. The original intention behind Elliot and his companions' particular adoption of the local practice was thereby destabilized, since the motif was hijacked and became the marker of a wider group among the crew.[16](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-16) Such ready commandeering and rapid diffusion of a Pacific motif is striking, and confirms the particular appeal that tattooing held for sailors and the potential speed at which this practice could spread among them. Alfred Gell proposed that mariners' interest in tattooing stemmed from its potential to express their class position, lifestyle or their unique _habitus_, that is, world views that were products of their social location and manifest in their personal habits and preferences. Therefore, on encountering tattooing in the Pacific, sailors rapidly 'made it their own'.[17](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-17) Greg Dening described how

The essence of a sailor's existence was to be utterly without space he could call his own, to have all his possessions calculated narrowly, to be a totally public man to his peers and to be totally public to superiors who could muster him twice daily at his quarters.[18](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-18)

Living under such constrained circumstances, in a confined and unpredictable social world and isolated from friends and family, sailors found in tattooing a unique means of reaffirming both their individual identities and their personal relationships. In contrast with their controlled, shipboard life, the marking of the body offered them an unrestrained and autonomous space for both private and public expression. Since seamen lived in close proximity to one other and shared experiences at close quarters, such innovative means of self-expression are likely to have diffused exponentially throughout the seafaring world. Similarly, the practice is understood to have attracted and diffused among another marginalized group that came into contact with mariners: transported convicts.[19](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-19)

Descriptions of the _Bounty_ mutineers recorded by William Bligh in 1789 indicate how, two decades after Cook's first voyage, the adoption of tattooing was already a growing phenomenon among sailors. Indeed, in his inclusion of tattoos for crew identification purposes, Bligh unknowingly pre-empted a trend that emerged in the navy over the coming decades and became formalized practice by the 1830s. That tattooing was common among everyday seamen who had travelled to the Pacific, and visible within their own particular social world, but might have been less known among their superiors, is evidenced by the fact that Bligh depended on the mutineers' peers for descriptions of the various motifs on the bodies of the individual 'pirates'.[20](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-20)

Twenty-two of the 25 mutineers described by Bligh were tattooed. In some cases details are vague, with individuals referred to as being 'very much tattooed',[21](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-21) but in others more intriguing descriptions are provided. Peter Heywood, for example, was marked with the 'three legs of the Isle of Man', a clear assertion of his Manx nationality. Thomas Ellison was tattooed on his right arm with his name and also with the date, 25 October 1788, the day the _Bounty_ first arrived in Tahiti. He had thereby apparently elected to mark a critical moment in his personal history.[22](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-22) Other mutineers were also marked with their initials, dates or motifs, such as hearts. In common with many of their predecessors, the mutineers therefore appear to have largely employed indigenous expertise to create European motifs, using familiar symbolic and literal references. Innovation also took place. One of the mutineers, Adam Smith, for example, extended the convention of marking initials and dates to the body of his Tahitian lover: his initials and a significant date were tattooed on her arm.[23](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-23) A number of the _Bounty_ mutineers had, however, adopted Tahitian motifs on parts of the body consistent with local convention, including the chest, legs, body, backside and feet. The Tahitian star that had such an impact on Elliott and his messmates, for example, re-emerged on the body of Fletcher Christian. Further innovation can be discerned with regard to the appropriation of Pacific motifs. One of the mutineers was described as being tattooed under the pit of his stomach with the ornamental design of the _taumi_, or Tahitian breastplate.[24](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-24) In this case, similar to Heywood's use of the Manx emblem, a familiar schematic or ornamental design had been transferred from material objects to the body through tattooing, a practice that already existed in Western Polynesian tattooing – although, as far as is known, the _taumi_ was not in fact part of the lexicon of indigenous Tahitian tattoo motifs during the period in question. This process, defined by Gell as 'scheme transfer',[25](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-25) had become an identifiable convention in European tattooing by the following century.[26](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-26)

The striking combination of both European and Tahitian markings on the bodies of the mutineers can be understood as a physical registration of a multitude of factors. Indigenous tattooing expertise had been used to assert the sailors' identities, commemorate particular life events, mark personal relationships and express new cultural influences. In sum, the mutineers' engagement in tattooing was a unique reflection of their hybrid associations, both European and Tahitian.[27](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-27)

Naval records held at the Public Record Office in the United Kingdom have documented how permanent body markings had become a significant indicator of a professional seafarer by the 1830s, by which time a growing range of popular motifs had emerged. The tattooing of names, initials and dates and designs such as man, woman and child – a striking symbol of domesticity for those away from home for prolonged periods – were all common. Other motifs that have since become more stereotypical mariners' markings, such as mermaids, anchors, hearts, stars and crucifixes, are also common. Early encounters with Pacific Islanders therefore appear to have made a lasting contribution to Western maritime culture in terms of the adoption of tattooing as popular practice, if not in terms of motif content.

Europeans (and later Americans) who found themselves resident in Pacific communities for an extended period of time in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, both voluntarily or involuntarily, also adopted tattooing as a result of contact with local populations, but in forms more closely related to indigenous convention. The term 'beachcomber' was coined to describe individuals who spent long periods living on Pacific islands. These included deserters, discharged crew, castaways, captives of ambitious local leaders and runaway convicts. A number of beachcombers published accounts of their experiences on their return home. Although problematic in many ways as historical records, these diverse accounts nonetheless shed new light on the nature of cross-cultural encounters during the early period of contact, including the interactions and social relationships that resulted in a number of beach-combers becoming tattooed.

From the moment of their arrival, beach-combers found themselves in an ambiguous situation and had little control over their standing or status within the communities among which they found themselves. In Ian Campbell's words, they could be 'used, discarded or destroyed' by Island inhabitants.[28](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-28) James O'Connell, shipwrecked in the Caroline Islands in the 1820s, for example, betrayed his uncertainty at his position when he described being 'adopted' by a local chief soon after his arrival, referring to his patron as 'my new friend, or master, or owner, – I do not know exactly how he considered himself'.[29](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-29) A common experience depicted in both beachcomber narratives (and, indeed, in many voyage accounts of the same period) is the immediate removal by the local population of all the possessions of the new arrivals, including the clothes they were wearing. These prized articles were often appropriated for local use, including exchange purposes. Horace Holden, who was shipwrecked on one of the Palau Islands, described one of the first interactions he and his crewmates had with a local man, 'After pretty thoroughly convincing us that in this case our only course was submission, he began to strip us of our clothing.'[30](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-30) This removal of clothing by local people may be interpreted as an immediate attempt by Islander hosts to force new arrivals to conform to local codes of conduct. In their introduction to the journal of William Lockerby, a sandalwood trader who was resident in the Fiji Islands, for example, Everard ImThurn and Leonard Wharton proposed that the practice of relieving shipwrecked sailors of their clothing meant 'no more than that the islanders reduced the clothes of their visitors to that which they thought proper for themselves'.[31](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-31) Whatever motivations prompted such treatment, this literal stripping of the trappings of European civilization exposed the physical vulnerability of beach-combers within their new cultural setting.

Given their uncertain position, establishing useful allegiances and a recognizable role for themselves was vital for beachcombers' comfortable existence, and even their survival.[32](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-32) While new arrivals were often accorded similar status among local communities as they were perceived to hold in their own, based on indicators such as dress and apparent position in the ship hierarchy,[33](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-33) conversely, those with no immediately recognizable status often found themselves at a disadvantage, open to ridicule and abuse and even living with restricted access to food.[34](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-34) Those who held skills in areas that were prized by Pacific communities, such as the employment and maintenance of firearms, the production of iron, the use of razors, or even the playing of musical instruments or dancing, found themselves able to exploit these talents and use them to establish firmer reciprocal relationships with Islanders.[35](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-35) Indeed, Vanessa Smith even argues that the treatment of beach-combers with aptitude in certain practical skills often constituted an inversion of the prevailing system of class and status in Europe, due to the consequent prestige and authority awarded to visitors who were manually gifted.[36](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-36) As John Twyning, shipwrecked on Vatoa, one of the Lau Islands of Fiji, in 1829 described, he and his crew-mates provided valued services to their chiefly host:

If we staid at home we were employed in furbishing his firearms and keeping them in repair. The service of one or other of us was sure to be required whenever his highness wished to be shaved, because he conceived a white man could perform this operation more dexterously than a native.[37](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-37)

In some cases, the novel skills that beach-combers offered provided such individuals with one of their few sources of leverage among their adopted communities. William Diapea, who was resident in Fiji towards the middle of the nineteenth century, for example, related how he resisted the treatment he received as he was paraded as a novelty, the _manu manu_ (pet bird), of a chief in the Islands, by refusing to repair muskets, a task usually assigned to him.[38](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-38) Several narratives detailed beachcombers' attempts to hoard their practical skills and prevent native people from learning them, a phenomenon that underlines how often the foreign visitors were highly aware of the tenuousness of their position.[39](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-39)

During this early contact period, the balance of power with respect to lone individuals or small groups of men isolated from the security of their ships lay firmly with the indigenous population. New arrivals were admitted into communities conditionally by people convinced of the correctness of their own social codes.[40](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-40) As a consequence, local norms of behaviour were frequently imposed upon beachcombers. Dening claimed that the participation of officers and sailors who were merely transient visitors in indigenous rituals such as name-exchange could be considered a fiction, a game to be played with mock solemnity. However, beachcombers who were resident for longer periods were faced with the social consequences and obligations of their incorporation within local communities.[41](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-41) This is exemplified in accounts of the pressure that was exerted on new residents to conform to local norms governing the treatment of the body. In addition to the removal of clothing, many narratives detailed how newcomers were pressurized to remove their facial and body hair in conformity with indigenous aesthetic values concerning physical appearance. In a number of cases, their bodies became sites of enforced transformation, as their facial hair was extracted using pearl-shells.[42](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-42)

Similarly, tattooing was presented in a number of the narratives as a process that beachcombers were pressurized to undergo. A common theme emerges of both coercion and encouragement from native people, which resulted in conformity on the part of beachcombers. Holden, for example, described the experiences of being tattooed that he shared with his crewmates during their stay at the Palau Islands:

To our sorrow, we were . . . compelled to conform to the custom . . . and shall carry with us to the grave the marks of the well-meant, though cruel operations upon our bodies.[43](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-43)

Holden's reference to the practice being 'well-meant' conveys his understanding of the importance placed on such conformity to local people. Indeed, given the significance of tattooing in many Pacific societies, the pressure placed on beachcombers by Islanders to have their bodies similarly marked is likely to have been considerable. Such indigenous agency in the tattooing of foreign visitors needs to be understood in both cosmological and social terms. For many of the communities among which the beachcombers resided, tattooing was a fundamental cultural practice, vital to social reproduction. Those who did not conform to this process were either pre-adolescent, of very low class or, on rare occasions in locations such as Tonga, those of the highest rank, closest to the deities. In his comprehensive analysis of tattooing in Polynesia, Gell emphasized the importance of tattooing in making a person 'whole' in many Pacific societies. Being tattooed at adolescence was a process of desanctification, rendering individuals 'safe' to engage in adult activities such as sexual and exchange relations (although particular modes of tattooing, when and to whom they applied and their social meaning varied from location to location).[44](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-44) It could therefore be argued that beachcombers who were not tattooed, and yet resided in Pacific communities and sought to engage in social relationships, did not 'fit' into any clear category. Their socially _un_integrated bodies were an overt and constant transgression of cultural norms. In contrast, by becoming tattooed through accepted ritualistic processes, a cosmologically 'safer' and more coherent position could be established for them.

The pressure placed on beachcombers to become tattooed was therefore a consequence of their residence, a process they were required to undergo not only to become more viable members of their host societies but to mark the status assigned to them or the status to which they aspired through their attempts to forge meaningful relationships. Several narratives explicitly detailed the role that becoming tattooed played in the assimilation of foreign visitors. Joseph Kabris, a Frenchman who resided in the Marquesas Islands from 1796 to 1804 as a result of being shipwrecked along with other crewmates, described their early experiences as follows:

For about four months we were treated with great deference and care by the islanders. At this time the _quaitenouiy_[45](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-45) urged us to be tattooed all over, which these people regard as a mark of manhood . . . After the ceremony, which made us belong to the tribe, we each chose a wife and were married according to the islanders' custom.[46](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-46)

For Kabris and his crewmates, becoming tattooed was clearly a significant rite of passage that established their membership of the group. Similarly, O'Connell related how he and his crewmate were pressurized to be tattooed and were removed from public society for a number of days in order for the process to be completed. As a result of his pragmatic submission, O'Connell described how he emerged 'a bird of much more diversified plumage than when I entered, being tattooed on my left hand, on both arms, legs, thighs, back and abdomen'.[47](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-47) As in the case of Kabris, immediately on the completion of this process the two men were married to local women. In fact, the extent to which they willingly acceded to being tattooed appears to have defined their future status among their hosts, since O'Connell went on to explain how in the case of his crewmate 'his unwillingness to submit to the process of tattooing wedded him to a woman of no rank'.[48](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-48) Hence, whether they were aware of it or not, by consenting to be tattooed beachcombers were providing themselves with important symbolic capital.[49](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-49)

Tattooing was simultaneously a product and an expression of the beachcombers' social relationships within Pacific communities. In the case of Kabris, for example, many of the tattoos depicted in Alexander Orlovsky's celebrated drawing of him, engraved by R. Cooper for the English edition of Georg von Langsdorff's narrative of the Russian voyage to the Marquesas Islands in 1804 (illus. 46), evidently related to his status in the Islands: the partial facial mask indicated his title as a son-in-law;[50](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-50) a breastplate on the right breast signified his standing as a warrior;[51](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-51) and the tattooed eye marked his membership of a specific feasting society.[52](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-52)

A crucial feature of the beachcomber's experience was his ability to resist engaging in practices that he found morally abhorrent, such as cannibalism and infanticide, and his frequent transgression of other local codes of behaviour – whether knowingly or otherwise – with relatively little redress. Indeed, in some cases beachcombers even found themselves immune to or able to resist the sanctions associated with _tapu_.[53](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-53) Some voyage accounts and a number of beachcomber narratives emphasized European resistance to indigenous codes concerning the treatment of the body, for example, particularly concerning the baring of the individual's head and shoulders in the presence of those of chiefly status, a demonstration of deference that was standard practice in many Pacific societies, and heavily punished if not adhered to. Such resistance reflects the importance that many European visitors placed on their own customary norms relating to the body. However, the attempted infringement of such normally non-negotiable codes of behaviour by beachcombers was not always blithely accepted by Islanders. When Morrison and several other _Bounty_ mutineers expressed their desire to meet a young chief in one of the Society Islands, for example, they were told they would not be authorized to see him unless they stripped their clothing from their heads and shoulders. When they refused to do this because they asserted it to be 'not customary' in their native society, they were apparently forced to compromise by placing a cloth over their bare shoulders.[54](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-54)

The extent to which beachcombers were able to resist customary norms of behaviour appears to have depended on the relationship that they were able to cultivate with their chiefly patron(s). Hence William Mariner, who was shipwrecked in Tonga in 1806 and protected by the Vava'u chief Finau, did not conform to the convention of baring his head in the chief's presence. Yet he was regularly reminded of to whom he owed this privilege. As described in the published account,

the king used frequently to tell Mr Mariner, that if he ever met any common fellow with his head covered, he should immediately knock him down. He was, however, like other foreigners, to wear a head-dress without any restriction, as being supposed to be governed by different gods, and accustomed to different manners.[55](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-55)

Given such attempts by some Europeans to cling tenaciously to aspects of their own cultural codes of dress and behaviour, it is likely that the pressure to become tattooed resulted in resistance among some Europeans. As O'Connell's earlier account of his crewmate suggests, a process of negotiation and resistance regarding the process of tattooing is likely to have characterized some encounters. Edward Robarts, an Englishman who was shipwrecked and lived in the Marquesas Islands from late 1797 to 1806, overlapping with Kabris, appears to have demonstrated a much more selective engagement in local practices than his French counterpart. Indeed, European visitors to the Marquesas who met both men were struck with Robarts's limited acquaintance with local language and customs compared with the Frenchman's.[56](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-56) The Englishman's engagement with tattooing was perhaps, therefore, consistent with his more distanced, selective participation in indigenous cultural practices. Most contemporary accounts indicated that he only submitted to being marked on the chest with a motif indicating his membership of a feasting society.[57](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-57) He justified this engagement in tattooing to other visiting Europeans as induced by his need to survive. Joining a feasting group, he claimed, made his life considerably easier.

In contrast, however, many beachcombers engaged willingly – albeit selectively – with indigenous tattooing traditions. This is particularly evident in the case of beachcombers who voluntarily resided among communities in the Pacific Islands over the long-term. Such individuals are remarkable not only because of their enthusiastic participation in local practices but the levels of identification with indigenous culture that ensued. Indeed, it appears that some beachcombers not only deliberately conformed to local manners and customs as a practical strategy but took on local symbolic and cultural references as their own. Joseph Kabris is a striking case in point. Kabris willingly engaged in local networks, forged a recognized place for himself within the chiefly class, married a chief's daughter, successfully engaged in local warfare, and, as described above, bore the tattoos that indicated his status. Essentially 'he became all but Marquesan'.[58](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-58) By the time of his departure on one of the ships from the first Russian voyage to the Pacific, he had virtually forgotten his native French. His identification with Marquesan values was so complete that, when offered a good new shirt, he desired to exchange it for a shabby red jacket, which he prized for its colour in a similar way to other Islanders, among whom red had significant symbolic value. There is every indication that he was removed from the Marquesas Islands by mistake and did not willingly return to Europe.

The fact that it was frequently possible for beachcombers to negotiate non- or partial compliance with certain practices serves to highlight how some individuals deliberately and pragmatically chose to become assimilated, due to the understood benefits that this could bring in terms of their relationships with local people. Tattooing may have been one of the means most available to them to express their commitment to conform. This is evident from the case of the crew member of the _Discovery_, described at the opening of this chapter, who, according to Ledyard, deliberately became tattooed in order to win favour with his New Zealand 'mistress' and her countrymen.

Similarly, Heywood, a _Bounty_ mutineer resident in Tahiti, explained his reasons for being tattooed: 'it was my constant endeavour to acquiesce in any little custom which I thought would be agreeable to them, though painful in the process, provided I gained by it their friendship and esteem'.[59](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-59) While the explanation provided by Heywood is not as straightforward as it might appear (Bligh's description of him, cited earlier, revealed that he had been tattooed with European motifs during his first visit to Tahiti and therefore was clearly engaging in this practice on several levels), it nonetheless reveals how beachcombers conformed to certain behaviour that they knew would facilitate social relationships. Given the often precarious status of beachcombers in their adoptive communities, such means of assimilation would bring definite advantages.

The process whereby beachcombers became tattooed can, therefore, be usefully understood as a convergence of both indigenous and European agency. While some visitors might have deliberately adopted this practice for perceived benefits, such behaviour always took place within a context of indigenous articulation of the significance of tattooing, and, conversely, the negative status of the 'non'-tattooed' within indigenous culture. Many of the narratives of those who became tattooed provided accounts of indigenous attitudes towards those who had not undergone this process, perceptions that presumably had been communicated to the Europeans who fell into this category. Hence Heywood described how in Tahiti a person without tattoos was considered to be 'bearing a most indignant badge of disgrace, and considered as a "mere outcast of society"'.[60](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-60)

Similarly, other beachcombers referred to the 'disgrace' and 'shame' associated with not being tattooed. Holden, for example, elaborated on the perceptions of their Palau Islander hosts towards their foreign visitors: 'to go at large without being tattooed, was to carry with us the palpable proofs of our vulgarity'.[61](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-61) For these individuals, the sense of existing physically against the indigenous scheme of things had clearly been conveyed to them.[62](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-62) Therefore, as Gell argued, beachcombers' choice to adopt tattooing cannot be accounted for in purely European terms. The significance of the practice among indigenous peoples had been transmitted, at least in part, to the resident visitors.[63](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-63) The transformation of beachcombers' bodies was therefore a product not only of their new social relationships, but their sense of themselves within a new cultural setting.

The experiences of George Vason, who was landed on Tongatapu in April 1797 as part of the first missionary enterprise in the region, provide an illustrative example. Soon after his arrival, Vason began to adopt Tongan norms of dress and behaviour, thereby estranging himself from his Christian brethren, who could only hope for his 'recovery'.[64](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-64) The renegade missionary married into a family of chiefly status, became a landowner and participated in the civil wars that burgeoned towards the end of the eighteenth century and eventually forced him to return to Europe. Vason became tattooed relatively late in his residence and represented this process as submission to sustained pressure from the young men with whom he associated, who mocked him for lacking the body markings that all Tongan men were not only expected to bear to demonstrate their manhood but took great pride in displaying.[65](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-65) He finally elected voluntarily to become tattooed after successful engagement in war and the celebration of battle victories, when male pride and exhibitionism was likely to be at its peak and hence the social significance of tattooing among Tongan men at its most explicit. Vason's description of himself once the permanent marking of his body was completed is a uniquely celebratory account; his thrill at his new appearance is palpable, revealing some level of identification with his adopted hosts:

I was very much admired by the natives, as the Euro pean skin displays the blue colour, and the ornaments of the tattooing to very great advantage: I looked indeed very gay in this new fancy covering.[66](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-66)

Dening argued that beachcombers existed on the boundaries of two worlds, transgressing social codes in both and belonging to neither.[67](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-67) The precariousness and vulnerability of their status in both worlds often becomes most apparent in their narratives on the arrival of ships bearing representatives of their own native societies. Although many beachcombers forged a role for themselves as mediators between Pacific communities and European and American ships, their position among their compatriots was rarely comfortable. The physical appearance of many of these individuals had often been so transformed through their adoption of local dress and tattoos that it was not uncommon for those on visiting ships to mistake them for Islanders on first encounter.[68](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-68) As Heywood recalled on first meeting European sailors who arrived during his residence on Tahiti, 'being dressed in the country manner, tanned as brown as themselves, and I tattooed like them in the most curious manner, I do not wonder at their taking us for natives'.[69](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-69)

When such cases of mistaken identity were resolved, a negative association was often made between beachcombers' unconventional physical appearance and their moral integrity. Hence, for example, the German naturalist Langsdorff referred to Kabris, whom he encountered during the Russian voyage to the Marquesas Islands early in the nineteenth century, as 'both morally and physically transformed into a savage'.[70](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-70) Such conflation of physical appearance and morality was common in the representation and understanding of indigenous people during the early contact period. Due to the transformation of their bodies, beachcombers were considered 'worse' than natives since they were perceived as having consciously rejected the supposedly civilized values of their home societies. On meeting the beach-comber James Coleman in one of the Sandwich Islands, for example, George Vancouver commented,

He had in most respects adopted the customs of the natives, particularly in dress, or rather in nakedness; for, excepting the _maro_, which he wore with much less decency than the generality of the inhabitants, he was perfectly naked . . . and seemed greatly to exult in having degenerated into a savage way of life.[71](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-71)

Evidently the forms of physical transformation, including tattooing, that had provided markers of inclusion for beachcombers within their adopted Pacific communities, cementing social relationships and enabling them to be more readily assimilated, created a palpable cultural distance between these individuals and their own compatriots. Hence Vason's description of the vulnerability and apprehension he experienced when on board the ship returning him to Europe,

my mind was not at ease . . . and ashamed of my own exposed appearance among those who were more decently clothed (for I was still in want of many articles of dress), I began to reflect on my past strange life and conduct, and look forward with shame and anxiety to a return to my native country.[72](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-72)

The feelings described here by Vason are in striking contrast with his unrestrained _in situ_ enthusiasm for Tongan practices, detailed earlier in his narrative. This account, written after Vason's return to the Church, can partly be understood as an attempt on his part to communicate the shame and remorse he felt his intended readership in 'civilized' society expected from him, due to his from 'fall from grace'. Yet whatever the primary intent behind his narrative, clearly the displacement of his transformed body into a new setting resulted in Vason's sudden awareness of his physical and cultural estrangement from his compatriots, and the implications of this for his return to Europe.

Clothing could be replaced, but tattoos were a permanent marker of beachcombers' residence in the Pacific Islands. They were interpreted by other Europeans as physical symbols of their transgression from and rejection of the values of their native culture. The more visible and irreversible the transformation, the more problematic the individual's reincorporation into his own native society. As one traveller observed in his account of a beachcomber in the Marquesas Islands, which was published in 1838, 'he is tattooed across the face, and will therefore probably never return to England'.[73](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-73) For those who did return home, such as George Bruce, who spent many years living among the Maori at the turn of the eighteenth century, life did not prove easy. In Bruce's appeal to the Treasury of the Royal Navy, he lamented his existence back in England and requested to be allowed to return to the Pacific. The former beachcomber made an explicit link between the treatment he received from 'the lower classes' and the visibility of his tattoos:

Life is a burden to him in this Kingdom. some calls him a Man Eater, another says his is the Devil & others calls him a Traitor To his Country. & this is because he don't sattisfie Them all, with the marks in his face.[74](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-74)

Herman Melville's semi-fictional account of a sailor's experiences in the Marquesas Islands, _Typee_, first published in London in 1847, encapsulated many of the preoccupations of earlier beachcomber narratives.[75](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-75) The protagonist of the novel, Tommo, who deserted his ship in order to live among a Marquesan community, was simultaneously attracted and repelled by the exotic world he saw around him and lived in fear of being destroyed by his adoption of the 'savage' way of life. This dominant theme was captured by Melville in Tommo's descriptions of tattooing that is variably depicted as both elegant, artful and grotesque. Late in his stay, Tommo was pressurized by the local people to have his body marked in what he understood to be a bid to 'convert' him to the indigenous 'religion' of tattooing. He strenuously resisted this pressure.[76](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-76) Tommo's almost hysterical fear of being tattooed on his face and therefore never being able to return and live among his own countrymen is telling, and may betray Melville's knowledge of the experiences of Western men who had adopted indigenous Pacific tattooing and then attempted to reintegrate within their native societies.

Tattooed beachcombers who returned home dealt with their anomalous status in various ways. It could well be argued that the depiction in a number of beachcomber narratives of the adoption of tattoos as an outcome of pressure from indigenous communities was an attempt by returning 'transgressors' to play down their own personal volition in an attempt to avoid alienating their readership. This is likely to be true in the case of John Rutherford, who asserted that the markings on his face and body were a result of his being forcibly tattooed over a period of four hours while being held down by several members of the Maori community among whom he lived for ten years.[77](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-77) Since the varied motifs are indigenous to several different island groups in the Pacific, and the _moko_, or Maori tattooing, borne by Rutherford on his face is usually carried out over a much longer period, his claims have been largely discredited.

The contemporary account of Rutherford's return to England described how he occasionally showed his tattoos in public and recounted his adventures, although he was averse to displaying his body for money.[78](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-78) Other individuals, including Kabris and O'Connell, opportunistically exhibited their tattooed bodies on their return to the metropoles. Indeed, O'Connell might have been the first tattooed man to be exhibited in an American circus. For nineteen years, until his death in 1854, he is known to have earned his livelihood through displaying his marked body and performing the Irish jig that had so enthralled his Pacific hosts.[79](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-79) It appears that some former beachcombers, therefore, deliberately exploited the 'otherness' that they represented in their home communities. Through performative displays, the tattoos that had been customary marks of belonging in the Pacific context were deliberately transformed into spectacular symbols of exotic ornamentation within a new social context.

The problematic position of those who had become tattooed in the Pacific Islands was not consigned solely to beachcombers. John Ledyard, who accompanied Cook on his third voyage in the 1770s and was tattooed in Tahiti, described the differing receptions he received during his travels subsequent to his trip to the Pacific, exposing the shifting and unanchored meaning of tattooing in different metropolitan cultural contexts during a period when the practice was still relatively unfamiliar to most Europeans. While visiting France, where round-the-world voyaging was well known, Ledyard described how when 'The Otaheite marks on my hand were discovered; the mistress and the maid asked our servants the history of so strange a sight? They were answered that I was a gentleman who had been round the world. It was enough.'[80](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-80) On this occasion, Ledyard's presentation of himself as a man of status bearing souvenirs of his travels was accepted. His later reception in Russia, where such voyages were still unfamiliar, was somewhat different, however: 'I am a curiosity here . . . Unfortunately, the marks on my hands procure me and my countrymen the appellation of wildmen.'[81](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-81) Here, Ledyard was no longer in control of the 'reading' of his body and status, since observers in a different cultural context perceived his tattoo marks as synonymous with barbarism. Ledyard's experiences reveal how the tattooing process was not only intrinsically linked to the social environment in which an individual became tattooed but that what was accomplished could only be understood in relation to the social environment in which such body modification was perceived. In contexts where tattooing was not a recognized, conventional practice, its meanings were unstable and were transformed as the body moved through time and space.[82](19_Reference.xhtml#ref3-82)

The differing engagement of Europeans with the indigenous tattooing practices they encountered in the Pacific reflect both the variety of cross-cultural exchanges that took place during the classic period of voyaging and the different legacies of encounters in the Pacific. For many beachcombers, becoming tattooed in indigenous fashion was a fundamental outcome of their residence in Pacific communities, a product of the social relationships that were established, or which individuals attempted to forge in order to become assimilated. The permanent markers that ensued from these relationships became a source of spectacle in non-Pacific contexts. In the case of more transient, visiting sailors, cross-cultural encounters in the Pacific exposed them to the potential for tattooing to express their own individual and collective relationships and new expertise to facilitate this expression. Seafarers rapidly established ownership over this practice, which became a symbol of their trade. These varied outcomes of exposure to Pacific tattooing are both likely to have contributed to modern understanding of and engagement in the practice in Western societies.# CHAPTER SEVEN

## ‘Tattoo’ and/as Translation:  
Gell, _Wrapping in Images_ and the  
Pacific Body

Rod Edmond

In his influential study _Wrapping in Images: Tattooing in Polynesia_ (1993), Alfred Gell argued that tattooing was a technology of the body for the creation of political subjects in traditional Polynesian society. In the Pacific, he suggested, tattooing was a complex practice that ‘expressed hierarchy and domination’ and yet was ‘most ardently sought where, in effect, it was most obligatory’. This paradox, he argued, derived from tattooing’s function as a technology that ‘train[ed]’ the body for its role in the political field, ‘torture[ing]’ it and ‘forc[ing] it to emit signs’ of status and identity. Gell’s focus was on the social and political role of tattooing, but he also emphasized its aesthetic properties, arguing that tattooing in Polynesia was a form of visual art that was both ‘protective’ and ‘defensive’, creating a ‘second skin’ of images and texts that defined the self in relation to society. In contrast, he argued, tattooing in the modern West was largely associated with marginalized subcultures and the lower classes, and was negatively valenced in dominant discourses, yet still functioned as a technology for the making of persons, albeit in ways that excluded rather than included them in social privileges.

Gell’s work has been widely cited and discussed in relation to the revival of Pacific tattooing practices in contemporary contexts, and the ways in which these practices are being reinterpreted and reimagined in relation to traditional cultural values and modern identities. In particular, his emphasis on the social and political dimensions of tattooing has been influential in understanding the ways in which tattooing can be used as a form of cultural resistance and assertion of identity in the face of colonial and postcolonial pressures. His work has also been cited in relation to the broader question of the relationship between the body and power, and the ways in which the body can be both a site of subjection and a means of subjectification.

However, Gell’s work has also been criticized for its focus on traditional Polynesian society and its lack of attention to the ways in which tattooing practices have been transformed and adapted in contemporary Pacific contexts. In particular, critics have argued that Gell’s emphasis on the ‘anchored’ nature of Pacific tattooing practices ignores the ways in which these practices have been ‘unanchored’ and recontextualized in modern times, particularly in relation to tourism, commodification and globalization. Moreover, his comparative glance at Western tattooing has been seen as overly simplistic, ignoring the complex and varied meanings that tattooing can have in different Western contexts and subcultures.

Despite these criticisms, Gell’s work remains a foundational text in the study of Pacific tattooing, and his insights into the social and political functions of tattooing continue to be relevant to contemporary discussions of cultural identity and resistance in the Pacific. In particular, his emphasis on the ways in which tattooing can be both a form of subjection and a means of subjectification highlights the complex and contradictory nature of cultural practices in colonial and postcolonial contexts, and the ways in which these practices can be both imposed and appropriated, resisted and embraced, transformed and preserved.

In this chapter, I want to explore the ways in which Gell’s work can be read in relation to the broader question of translation and cultural exchange in the Pacific, and the ways in which tattooing practices can be understood as a form of translation between different cultural systems and values. In particular, I want to consider the ways in which tattooing practices have been translated and transformed in contemporary Pacific contexts, and the ways in which these practices continue to negotiate the complex relationships between tradition and modernity, local and global, self and other. I will argue that tattooing practices in the Pacific can be understood as a form of cultural translation that is both deeply rooted in traditional values and practices, and yet also highly adaptive and responsive to contemporary cultural and political conditions.

### Translation and Cultural Exchange in the Pacific

The question of translation in the Pacific has been a central concern of postcolonial studies, particularly in relation to the ways in which indigenous cultural practices and values have been translated and transformed through contact with European colonialism and its aftermath. Translation, in this context, is not simply a matter of linguistic transfer, but of cultural negotiation and exchange, involving the movement of meanings, practices and values between different cultural systems and contexts. As Homi Bhabha has argued, translation is a key site of cultural hybridity and difference, where the boundaries between cultures are both maintained and transgressed, and where new forms of cultural identity and expression can emerge.

In the Pacific, tattooing practices can be seen as a form of cultural translation that has been particularly significant in the negotiation of relationships between indigenous and colonial cultures. As we have seen in previous chapters, tattooing practices in the Pacific were encountered by European explorers, missionaries and colonial officials in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and were often interpreted through European cultural frameworks and values. These interpretations were frequently negative, associating tattooing with savagery, heathenism and criminality, and leading to attempts to suppress or eradicate tattooing practices in many Pacific islands.

However, tattooing practices in the Pacific also resisted and subverted these colonial interpretations, maintaining their own cultural meanings and values, and adapting to new conditions and contexts. In particular, the revival of tattooing practices in contemporary Pacific contexts can be seen as a form of cultural translation that negotiates between traditional values and modern identities, and between local and global cultural systems. As Sean Mallon and others have argued, contemporary Pacific tattooing practices are not simply revivals of traditional practices, but involve new forms of cultural expression and identity that are both rooted in tradition and responsive to contemporary conditions.

### The Body as Site of Translation

Gell’s work emphasizes the ways in which the body is a site of cultural and political significance in Pacific tattooing practices. He argues that tattooing in Polynesia was a technology that trained the body for its role in the political field, creating a ‘second skin’ of images and texts that defined the self in relation to society. This emphasis on the body as a site of cultural translation is particularly relevant to contemporary Pacific contexts, where tattooing practices continue to negotiate complex relationships between tradition and modernity, local and global, self and other.

In contemporary Pacific contexts, the body continues to be a site of cultural significance and negotiation, particularly in relation to questions of identity, belonging and cultural authenticity. As we have seen in the previous chapter, Tony Fomison’s tattooing by Sulu’ape Paulo ii can be understood as a complex negotiation of relationships between Pakeha and Samoan identities, and between individual and collective cultural values. Fomison’s tattooing was both a personal gesture of respect for Samoan cultural practices and a public statement of commitment to Pacific cultural values and identities.

Similarly, in contemporary Samoa, tattooing practices continue to negotiate complex relationships between traditional and modern values, and between local and global cultural systems. As Sean Mallon has argued, contemporary Samoan tattooing practices involve both the preservation of traditional designs and techniques and the adaptation of these practices to new conditions and contexts. In particular, the role of tattooing in contemporary Samoan society continues to be significant in relation to questions of identity, status and belonging, and yet also involves new forms of cultural expression and exchange that are responsive to contemporary Pacific conditions.

### The Unfixity of Tattoo

One of the key insights of Gell’s work is his emphasis on the ‘unfixity’ of tattoo as a cultural practice. He argues that tattooing in Polynesia was not simply a fixed or static cultural form, but involved complex negotiations of meaning and value that were responsive to changing social and political conditions. This emphasis on the unfixity of tattoo is particularly relevant to contemporary Pacific contexts, where tattooing practices continue to evolve and adapt in response to new cultural and political pressures.

In contemporary Pacific contexts, tattooing practices involve complex negotiations between traditional and modern values, and between local and global cultural systems. These negotiations are not simply about the preservation or revival of traditional practices, but involve the creation of new forms of cultural expression and identity that are both rooted in tradition and responsive to contemporary conditions. In particular, the role of tattooing in contemporary Pacific society continues to be significant in relation to questions of identity, status and belonging, and yet also involves new forms of cultural resistance and assertion that are adapted to contemporary political and cultural conditions.

Moreover, the unfixity of tattoo as a cultural practice also highlights the ways in which cultural meanings and values are not simply transmitted from one generation to the next, but are actively negotiated and renegotiated in each new cultural context. This emphasis on the active negotiation of cultural meanings and values is particularly relevant to Pacific contexts, where cultural practices have been transformed and adapted through contact with European colonialism and its aftermath, and where new forms of cultural identity and expression continue to emerge.

### Conclusion

Alfred Gell’s _Wrapping in Images_ remains a foundational text in the study of Pacific tattooing, and his insights into the social and political functions of tattooing continue to be relevant to contemporary discussions of cultural identity and resistance in the Pacific. In particular, his emphasis on the ways in which tattooing can be both a form of subjection and a means of subjectification highlights the complex and contradictory nature of cultural practices in colonial and postcolonial contexts.

In this chapter, I have argued that tattooing practices in the Pacific can be understood as a form of cultural translation that negotiates between different cultural systems and values. This translation involves both the preservation of traditional meanings and practices and the adaptation of these practices to new conditions and contexts. In contemporary Pacific contexts, tattooing continues to be a significant practice in relation to questions of identity, status and belonging, and yet also involves new forms of cultural expression and resistance that are adapted to contemporary conditions.

The unfixity of tattoo as a cultural practice highlights the ways in which cultural meanings and values are actively negotiated and renegotiated in each new cultural context. This emphasis on active negotiation is particularly relevant to Pacific contexts, where cultural practices have been transformed through contact with European colonialism and continue to evolve in response to contemporary cultural and political pressures. In this sense, tattooing practices in the Pacific can be seen as both traditional and modern, local and global, fixed and unanchored – a complex cultural form that continues to negotiate the relationships between different cultural systems and values in the contemporary Pacific world.But they too are part of him. Remarkably, Grace's photograph combines these two personas in a single image, thus dramatizing their dual and constitutive relationship, like the entangled therianthropes in _The Temptation of Brother Anthony_, to the artist's 'self'. Moreover, the masquerade ensnares _us_ in that relationship, its viewers, _for whom_ the 'self' is here performed. In his guise as tattooed colonial castaway, Fomison stares us down, invites us to deal with him; implicates us in the same effort of his double to dominate him, read him, take his measure.

# CHAPTER SEVEN

## Samoan _Tatau_ as Global Practice

Sean Mallon

Contemporary accounts of Samoan tattooing often privilege continuity over change and transformation. Today in Samoan society many people uphold _tatau_ as ancient and unchanging, a practice essentially Samoan in its location and practice. Across the Samoan diaspora images of _tatau_ are a distinctive and visible symbol of Samoan cultural pride or identity. In an era where global 'cultural flows' bring seemingly disparate peoples closer together, blurring the boundaries between cultures, they also seemingly make people cling more tightly to some of the cultural products, like _tatau_, that make them distinctive. Yet in historical perspective Samoan _tatau_ has long comprised a less stable and fixed set of cultural ideas than popularly believed. Circulation of the images of _tatau_ has given them relevance in diverse locations outside Samoa and beyond Samoan communities. In this survey, I review a somewhat fragmented history to argue that _tatau_ has long been a contested and changing practice. I also analyse some recent events that demonstrate how one family of _tatau_ practitioners continues to reach out to the world beyond Samoa, at once attempting to stabilize but also renegotiate the boundaries of their work. A history of Samoan tattooing practices contributes to our understanding of the process of globalization and what _tatau_ can and has meant to people in various times and places. It reminds us about the traffic in ideas and culture, and how Samoan _tatau_ and Samoan culture are implicated in these processes historically and in the present day.

### SAMOAN _TATAU_ (TATTOO)

In Samoa, the process of tattooing is known as _tatatau_. In relation to tattooing the word _ta_ means 'to strike' and the word _tatau_ refers to lines and motifs that are tattooed onto the body. Today, Samoan men tattooed in the Samoan style wear markings that extend from the waist down to the knee. This distinctive form of _tatau_ is called _pe'a_, and is made up of areas of dense shading and fine parallel line-work, interspersed with a wide range of motifs and geometric patterns. The overall structure of the _pe'a_ varies little from person to person, but in terms of the finer motifs that fill this structure each tattooist interprets and composes the imagery differently. The Samoan word _pe'a_ refers both to the male _tatau_ and to the fruit-eating bat known as the flying fox. Young Samoan men who are tattooed are called _soga'imiti_ and as such they are responsible for performing duties for _matai_ (village chiefs) at formal meetings and other events.

The name given to the main form of _tatau_ worn by women is _malu_. It appears on the legs, starting at the knees and finishing at the top of the thighs. Some nineteenth-century accounts indicate that the lower abdomen and right hand of women were sometimes tattooed,[1](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-1) and there are a few individuals who have had _tatau_ rendered on these parts of the body today, although it is uncommon. Overall, the _malu_ is less elaborate and not as densely patterned as the _pe'a_. The _malu_ takes its name from a particular motif of the same name, usually worn behind the knee, and is one of the key motifs not seen on men. In Samoan tattooing '_malu_' refers to notions of sheltering and protection.[2](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-2)

In Samoan society, the tattooing specialist is known as a _tufuga tatatau_. In the nineteenth century _tufuga tatatau_ were associated with two family branches, Su'a and Tulou'ena. The Sa Su'a worked mainly on Upolu and the Sa Tulou'ena mainly in Savai'i. The organization of these families is comparable to artisan guilds in other societies. Tattooing 'families' shared continuity over time as a group and were organized in a hierarchical master craftsman-apprentice fashion, each with particular rules, standards and distinctive trade marks.[3](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-3) This type of arrangement has meant that contemporary descendants of these families still work as _tufuga tatatau_ and the skills of _tatatau_ continue to be transferred from generation to generation. This is not to suggest an overwhelming vein of continuity in _tatatau_ practice, over time or within the families themselves. There is a growing number of Samoan and non-Samoan tattooing practitioners who do not belong to either of these families, but use Samoan motifs. Most render the work primarily with electric tattooing machines.

The hand-made tools used most often by _tufuga tatatau_ of the Sa Su'a and Sa Tulou'ena comprise a set of tattooing combs, and a short wooden rod or tattooing mallet. The hand tools are especially valued and are finely crafted. These '_au_, or tattooing combs, are made of three components: a small bone comb, a shell plate and a wooden handle to which they are attached. The tattooing combs are made to different widths, each designed to render a different quality of line. Some are used for filling in large dark areas, while others are used to make very fine lines and dots. The comb perforates the skin delivering the pigment into it, and is usually made from small sections of boar's tusk with a row of very small sharp teeth cut into it.[4](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-4) In the nineteenth century the tattooing combs were said to have been made from human bone, with one missionary saying that if possible the bone was 'procured from the body of a strong & daring chief'.[5](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-5) The combs were fixed with strands of coconut fibre to a turtle-shell plate, which in turn was fastened to a thin stick to form a handle. Today, turtle shell is still used, but is sometimes replaced with a piece of Perspex or metal. The coconut fibre is usually substituted with nylon fishing line. Restrictions on turtle fishing in the islands have made it difficult (but not impossible) for _tufuga_ to acquire turtle shell. The use of nylon fishing line perhaps allows the tools to be cleaned more easily between uses. Increasingly, familiarity with equipment such as ultrasonic cleaners and cleansing chemicals are required for _tufuga_ to work outside Samoa.

The _sausau_ is a wooden rod used to strike the '_au_ so that pigment is deposited from the comb into the skin. Internationally, commercial inks are used, although in Samoa, kerosene soot mixed with _bluo_ or candlenut soot and water have sufficed.[6](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-6) Often the pigment is mixed in a half coconut shell before it is spread on a palette made from a freshly picked leaf stretched across the top of an empty tin can or half coconut shell. The _tufuga_ draws the pigment from this palette before it is applied to the skin. I mention the material culture associated with _tatau_ because it is in various forms of material culture that we find clues relating to _tatau_ and its origins.

### ORIGINS

Archaeologists who study the material culture of humans in the Pacific have unearthed evidence that suggests that the origins of Samoan tattooing motifs lie with the early seafaring ancestors of Polynesian peoples. Around 1500 bc the ancestors of Polynesian people were making a form of distinctive decorated pottery that archaeologists call Lapita ware. It has been argued by some archaeologists that the motifs found on ancient Lapita pottery relate directly to those present in contemporary tattoo and bark-cloth decoration.[7](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-7) There is other convincing evidence for the connection between tattoo and the decorative elements found on Lapita pottery. As well as the stylistic similarities of the motifs, archaeological excavations of Lapita pottery-bearing sites in Tongatapu in Tonga have unearthed examples of tattooing chisels in the same context. In the Reef Islands in the Santa Cruz group, a Lapita site has produced what appears to be the buttocks of a small baked clay figurine, bearing images that may represent tattoo, and a small clay-modelled head with a facial tattoo has been reported from a Lapita site in Papua New Guinea.[8](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-8) Furthermore, linguistic reconstruction of the word _tatau_ and the word _uhi_ – the eastern Polynesian term for tattooing implement – also point toward an origin for _tatau_ early in the settlement of the Pacific.[9](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-9)

The inter-island influence and connections made through tattooing are also evident in origin accounts from Samoan folklore. According to stories and songs recorded in the nineteenth century, two sisters, Taema and Tilafaiga, who were Siamese twins, brought the first tattooing tools to Samoa. They acquired the tools and the instructions on how to use them from the tattooists Filelei and Tufou in Fiji. They were told to 'tattoo the women and not the men', and they sang this instruction over and over as they paddled their canoe to Samoa. On the way, as the story goes, they saw a large and beautiful shell glistening in the waters below and they stopped singing their song to swim down and fetch it. On returning to the surface they tried to remember what they were singing and got the song mixed up. 'Tattoo the men and not the women' they sang, and this was the message they took on to Samoa.[10](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-10) This reference to the origins of _tatau_ being located outside Samoa is a curious one, because it points to the non-indigenous origin of Samoan _tatau_ – a cultural practice 'essentially Samoan'.

Other contemporary explanations currently circulating among Samoans suggest a site called Fiti-uta in Samoa's eastern islands of Manu'a as an origin site, one possibly confused in the past with Fiji (Fiti). Beliefs among some contemporary _tufuga_ and Samoan _matai_ suggest Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East as origin sites (based largely on similarities between markings and motifs), with some saying that Fijians have no tradition of tattooing, despite evidence to the contrary.[11](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-11) But could Fiti, Viti or Fiji have been a reference to another location in the Samoan archipelago? and what or where was Fiti, Viti or Fiji in the context of this origin story? These questions are probably beyond any definitive answer, but what is clear is that the origins of _tatau_ are, as we shall see, as contested as its practice.

Accounts of tattooing in Samoa made at different times over the last 200 years describe customs, stories and songs, and transformations in style and meaning. They also highlight relationships in Samoan society and changing attitudes and responses to the increasing influence of the outside world. The historical sources provide valuable insight into the nature of cultural exchange, however, and if their specific details are difficult to verify, the more general points they make relating to the interaction and exchange mediated by _tatau_ are significant for the inter-archipelago connections they suggest.

### FRAGMENTED HISTORY AND CONTESTED PRACTICES

In 1721–2 a Dutch seafarer named Jacob Roggeveen made a long voyage from Cape Horn to New Ireland (near Papua New Guinea). On 14 June 1722 he sailed close to the islands of Olosega and Ofu, two of the easternmost islands of the Samoan archipelago. As Roggeveen's three ships passed by the islands he wrote about the inhabitants he sighted there:

The Indians of this first island are like the Paaschlanders in sturdiness and robustness of body, also in painting themselves, but not so much and abundantly, as their colouring commences from the thighs downward to the legs. Furthermore we did not see anything as covering for their nakedness, except a girdle round the waist to which a lot of long broad leaves or rushes, or of another plant, was fastened.[12](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-12)

This glimpse of 'colouring . . . from the thighs downward to the legs' is probably the first written description of Samoan _tatau_. It is one of many accounts of tattooing to emerge as European exploration progressed across the Pacific and encounters with local peoples became more common. Later, cultural encounters between British seaman and Tahitians would eventually see tattooing gain popularity in Europe, especially among the under classes (see White, this volume).[13](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-13) However, it is easy to forget that these types of cultural exchanges had also taken place among Pacific peoples for generations. For example, in the 1700s and possibly when Roggeveen was in the region, certain classes of Tongan nobles were tattooed by Samoans, some of them travelling to Samoa especially for this purpose. In Tonga, Samoans known as _matapule_ were part of an intermediate class of ceremonial attendants who played important roles in the Tongan social system. Tongan commoners were forbidden to touch the Tongan elite, so Samoans acting in this role 'could tattoo Tongan chiefs with immunity, cut their hair (the head of a Tongan chief is extremely _tapu_) and prepare their bodies for burial'.[14](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-14) In the 1800s Tongans were still travelling to Samoa to get tattooed, since King George Tupou I had forbidden the practice.[15](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-15)

Another early but more detailed account of the tattooing process comes from the missionary John Stair, who lived in Samoa from 1838 to 1845. He stated that all males from the ages of 12 to 15 and upward were tattooed and described the tattooing of a young chief. According to the custom of the time, sons of the _tulafale_ (orators/talking chiefs) of the district were expected to receive their tattoo simultaneously and share in the sufferings of their chief. Great interest was shown in the occasion and a large shed was usually erected in the _malae_ (village open space) where the tattooing would be performed. The young chief's family and people from all over the district would come to observe the proceedings and help to support the young men. The time taken to tattoo the young chief and his supporters could be anything from four to six weeks. During this period, friends, family and well-wishers staged evening entertainment in the form of dancing, sham fights and wrestling matches. When all the tattoos were complete, the _tufuga_ would receive the last of several payments for his work, consisting of hundreds of mats and large quantities of bark-cloth.[16](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-16)

This account from the late 1830s to mid-1840s is a snapshot of Samoan _tatau_ in a period when the Christian missionary presence in Samoa was only just becoming established. Over the course of almost a century (from the 1830s to the 1920s), the customs associated with _tatau_ would come under unprecedented pressure to be abandoned. The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were a period when colonial powers became established in Samoa, and trade and communication increased with countries both within and beyond the Pacific. Reading and writing, new technology and ideology transformed Samoa in many ways and Samoan people were to prove creative agents in the ways they dealt with new ideas and cultural products.

In nineteenth-century Samoa, the missionaries of the London Missionary Society (LMS) were particularly keen to ban tattooing, but the Catholic Marists were more tolerant. It seems that the LMS were not keen on the revelry and celebrations that took place in relation to the tattooing, rather than the act itself, and succeeded in abolishing tattooing in Tutuila before 1850, before it emerged again in the village of Leone in 1851.[17](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-17) Later in the 1860s the _matai_ of Manu'a banned tattooing for religious reasons. However, despite this ban, many of the young men of Manu'a took the opportunity to travel to Savai'i to get their _tatau_, although they were forbidden to return home.[18](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-18) By the 1890s this ruling had been revoked and young men were allowed to return to Manu'a on condition that they paid a fine to the church.[19](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-19) In other cases there was a clear reluctance to give up tattooing. A _matai_ in one account held out on the local missionaries and deferred 'making a profession of his new opinions till his son was tatooed, and thus admitted to manhood, according to heathen custom'.[20](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-20) What is clear is that Samoan men persisted in seeking opportunities to acquire _tatau_ in spite of local and foreign-imposed prohibitions, so it was not actually abolished across the archipelago as a whole at any one time. As I have mentioned, young Tongan men are said to have travelled to Savai'i to receive tattoo, the missionary prohibitions against tattooing being just as strong in the Tongan islands and having the support of the Tongan king.[21](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-21) Sunderland's remarks in September 1851 highlight how conflict on Upolu offered opportunities for young men on Tutuila to get tattooed.

There is a great desire manifested amongst many of the young men of the district to get tattooed. The custom seemed to be passing away on Tutuila, but the war on Upolu has revived it again and has induced many persons expert in the art of tattooing to resume their profession and a considerable number of young persons have secretly gone off to Upolu to get marked, as no person, at present, is allowed to tattoo on Tutuila.[22](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-22)

These mid-nineteenth-century episodes saw _tatau_ survive in different parts of the archipelago through to the turn of the century. It is difficult to trace stylistic developments and innovations in Samoan _tatau_ during this period, although an account from the 1920s clearly suggests that some design innovations were emerging from the _tufuga_ of the time. The homogeneity of _tatau_ practice in Samoa can be questioned when anthropologist Te Rangi Hiroa makes reference to a younger school of _tufuga tatatau_ and a move towards a breaking up of the dark areas of the _pe'a_ with the introduction of more ornamentation. This took the form of _fa'aila_, window-like design elements that framed motifs and isolated skin imperfections such as birthmarks. This was in contrast to the work of an older school, which preferred a greater proportion of plain bands and dark areas.[23](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-23)

This development suggests that the practice of _tatau_ was not uniform across the archipelago, and that there were different schools of thought within the families of _tufuga tatatau_. Individuals employed in tattooing were acting on creative impulse and possibly competing for business and status. They were also undoubtedly responding to new influences from the changing social environment around them, as well as new demands from their clientele. These developments remind us that an archipelago such as Samoa was not culturally homogeneous in the past.[24](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-24) It is true that the people of nineteenth-century Samoa were internally connected by shared ideas and concepts. However, villages and districts were often distinguished not only by their geographical location, but also by their diverse versions of origin stories, myths, local customs and specialized trades, or access to certain commodities. In relation to _tatau_, one nineteenth-century commentator remarked that certain districts had 'what may be called coats of arms in addition, – some animal usually, which serves to distinguish a man slain in battle'.[25](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-25)

The tattooing operation itself, as described by Te Rangi Hiroa, seems to have retained strong continuity in its practice, but the ritual that accompanies _tatau_ had become less elaborate and formalized. Some time in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the sham fights and wrestling that once accompanied the tattooing ritual were replaced by young men with modern musical instruments. The musicians would sit around their friend being tattooed singing to distract him from his pain in 'melodies . . . diffused from foreign music halls'.[26](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-26)

Few accounts of Samoan tattooing from the 1930s and '40s exist, but a remarkable series of 52 drawings made in the 1950s by J. W. Groves offer some insight into the cross-cultural entanglements of _tatau_ practices. As part of a manuscript in the British Museum Groves wrote:

There is a strong tendency nowadays to display the American Eagle in a tattoo design actually as the whole or part of the punialo. This would seem to be the result of occupation of the American troops during the war. There seems to be nothing incongruous to the Samoan mind in the spread eagle appearing in what is entirely a fa'asamoa [_sic_] decoration and it is quite impossible to convince them of it.[27](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-27)

Although there is a lack of contextual information about Groves's drawings, their very existence raises several questions. The types of images that appear suggest that American troops stationed in Samoa during the Second World War were an influence, but it is not established who made them, who wore them, why they were made and what the reaction was to them. The incorporation of the American eagle as part of the _punialo_ (a tattoo element situated above the groin), and Groves's report that there seemed to be 'nothing incongruous to the Samoan mind' as to whether it was a _fa'asamoa_ (Samoan customary) decoration or not, suggests that Samoan tattooists were open to new ideas and readily incorporating them into their cultural products. It seems Samoans not only appropriated foreign cultural forms into _tatau_, they also modified _tatau_ to suit non-Samoan demand. For example, a decade later, in the late 1960s, American Peace Corps volunteers in Samoa were behind the emergence of tattoos known locally as 'Peace Corps tatts' or _pe'a pisikoa_. These _taulima_ (armbands and wristlets) and _tauvae_ (anklets) are to this day popular souvenirs of Samoa for the tourists who can get them, and have become a significant form of _tatau_ for people of Samoan descent living overseas. Although many people and practitioners claim that this form of _tatau_ is recent, the _taulima_ form of tattooing appears to have existed from at least the 1890s. A group of 30 Samoan women visiting Berlin at this time were seen by Felix von Luschan to be tattooed on the arms with rings and armlets, highlighting a variation in tattooing practice not remarked upon in most ethnographic accounts.[28](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-28)

Despite these innovations for much of the early to mid-twentieth century, there is one account that questions the widespread popularity or relevance of _tatau_ in Samoan social life. When the anthropologist Tim O'Meara was in Samoa in the 1980s, he recalled seeing only one woman and no men over the age of 40 with a tattoo. He suggested that the resurgence of tattooing among young men probably began around the time of Samoan Independence in 1962. There could be some truth in this since Su'apa'ia writing in 1962 noted that people were refused admittance into chiefly assemblies unless they were tattooed.[29](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-29) He is not more specific but it is likely that his statement may refer only to a particular village or district, since there were and still are many Samoan _matai_ who are not tattooed. By 1990, however, one village on Savai'i had made it compulsory for all men to have the _pe'a_.[30](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-30) Whatever the case may be, a sustained local interest in _pe'a_ from the early 1960s onward is evident, and became especially so overseas.

This interest in _tatau_ has intensified not only in Samoa but also in Samoan populations abroad. As Samoans have migrated to cities such as Honolulu, Los Angeles, Sydney and Auckland, so too have aspects of their culture and customs. Today, among migrant Samoan communities, _tatau_ is widely considered a statement of Samoan heritage and identity. Within the Samoan cultural milieu some of the values recorded in the nineteenth century still resonate in ritual aspects of _tatau_ practice. But increasingly the _tatau_ has acquired a broader range of meanings and forms that are often specific to certain contexts. The _taulima_ or armband is probably the most popular form of _tatau_ among young Samoans in Auckland, New Zealand. (In the late 1990s the cost of a _taulima_ started at approximately New Zealand $50 ranging to around $100). Many young Samoan men and women wear it, since it is both affordable and quickly rendered. Generally speaking, for many young Samoans it has become an ethnic marker, a means of signifying Samoan heritage and an important link to what can sometimes seem like a distant heritage and way of life. The _tatau_ is such a strong image of Samoan heritage that its motifs are also appearing on clothing and apparel and have been reinterpreted by artists in new media and art forms.

### NON-SAMOANS AND _TATAU_

The tattooing of non-Samoans with Samoan _tatau_ is not uncommon, although it has been a point of controversy among leaders in Samoan communities in recent times. We know that historically Samoan _tufuga_ tattooed Tongans, but there are also records that indicate that _tufuga tatatau_ were tattooing Europeans from the earliest encounters. The missionary John Williams, who visited Samoa in 1832, described a tattooed English sailor named Jerry memorable for his accounts of his efforts to convert Samoans, but also for his tattooed belly and navel.[31](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-31) Another early account is from E. J. Wakefield, who, in recounting his adventures travelling through New Zealand in the early 1840s, described two characters he met in the countryside who had both escaped from a local jail:

One of them, an American named McLeod, had assumed the name of Mickey Knight . . . He spoke the native language very well, had with him a native wife from Thames, and had been tataued from the knees to the hips at the Navigator Islands [Samoa].[32](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-32)

The missionary Murray, working in Samoa in the nineteenth century, mentioned that in 1844, soon after returning from Upolu, he had a visit from a British man-of-war, the _Hazard_. Captain Bell, the commander, 'wished to take home in his own person a specimen of Samoan tatooing'. The locals at Pagopago were initially not keen to tattoo Bell, so Murray acted as a negotiator, explaining that 'What Captain Bell wished them to do for him was a very different thing to tattooing as they had been accustomed to practice it in their heathen state'. However, Murray also made clear in his account that he took care to guard against the incident being regarded as giving sanction to heathenism. Other foreigners living in Samoa said to have received the _pe'a_ include 'Old Tom Franklin', also known by the chiefly title Vavasa, who was still wandering around Samoa in the 1860s, having been there at least 20 years.[33](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-33) Later, during the German Administration, it is recorded that the German Governor of Samoa in 1912, Dr Erich E. Schultz, and a number of his officials, including Rudolph Berking, the Collector of Customs, also wore the _pe'a_.[34](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-34)

Other documented cases of tattooed nonSamoans include that of an American Peace Corps volunteer working in Samoa in the 1960s, a woman named Elsie Bach. She became friends with the Sulu'ape family, was tattooed with a _malu_ and bestowed with the Sulu'ape title.[35](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-35) We can only speculate on the benefits that wearing the _tatau_ had for these people at the time, but it must have offered some kind of benefit of incorporation, demonstrating perhaps a commitment or respect for the Samoan people and their culture, and an opportunity for the tattooed individual to enhance their own status. In Captain Bell's case, perhaps his _tatau_ was merely a memento of his visit. It is significant in the Peace Corps Volunteers' case that _tatau_ can be likewise considered a souvenir but also a mark of incorporation, with Americans making over their bodies into Samoan ones, in much the same way as Peace Corps Volunteers in Niger use Tuareg jewellery and hair braiding to achieve the same result.[36](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-36) It is also notable that in the 1970s a well-known American tattooist, Lyle Tuttle, visited Samoa and left having acquired a sample of Samoan _tatau_ and a _matai_ title.[37](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-37) Non-Samoans were visiting Samoa not just for the sun. They were actively seeking the _tatau_.

In the same way that, in the past, _tufuga tatatau_ travelled to the villages of Samoa and the courts of the Tongan elite, today the _tufuga_ has an international clientele and it is not unusual for _tufuga tatatau_ to fly to clients and tattoo conventions in cities such as Madrid, Miami and Amsterdam. Overseas clients also come to visit _tufuga_ both in New Zealand and Samoa, and not just for the _pe'a_. In 1981 Lesa Li'o, a _tufuga tatatau_ from Siumu, tattooed Ioteve Tuhipuha Puhetini from Rurutu of the Austral Islands.[38](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-38) After studying drawings of old Marquesan tattoo designs, the _tufuga_ took six weeks to reconstruct a Marquesan tattoo design on Ioteve that started at the neck and shoulders and extended the length of the body down to the ankles. Later, in 1982, three Samoan tattooists demonstrated _tatau_ at the annual Bastille Day celebrations in Tahiti, and by 1983–5 the Samoans had three Tahitians working with them, contributing to the renewed interest in tattoo in Tahiti and partly inspiring the current generation to begin tattooing again (see Kuwahara, this volume).[39](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-39)

Samoan tattooists have been travelling to New Zealand, where there is now a large Samoan and Polynesian population, from at least the early 1970s. The first Samoan _tufuga tatatau_ to begin tattooing in New Zealand was Tavu'i Pasina Sefo Ah Ken, who arrived in New Zealand in 1972. Later he was followed and joined by his cousin Su'a Sulu'ape Paulo II (1950–1999), who for a long time maintained the most visible presence and ongoing practice in New Zealand. He is survived by his brothers who continue to _tatau_ in Samoa, New Zealand, the United States and Europe. Other members of the Sa Su'a and Sa Tulou'ena work in New Zealand and include Su'a Vitale Fa'alavelave, who is currently based in Wellington.

The contemporary interest in Samoan _tatau_ and its changing relevance across the Samoan diaspora and among non-Samoan tattooing enthusiasts has meant that that _tufuga tatatau_ have had to alter their practice to suit new locations and client demands. The interaction of _tufuga_ with clients in Europe began with Su'a Sulu'ape Petelo's invitation to a tattooing convention in Rome in 1985. His brother Su'a Sulu'ape Paulo followed in the 1990s, with both of them winning prizes and recognition for their work. Their travel to the United States and Europe was the catalyst for new friendships and participation in a global community of tattooists.

In New Zealand Su'a Sulu'ape Paulo became particularly well established, and later a controversial figure. He worked tirelessly among Samoans living in Auckland, but was often criticized by them. At one stage, his acceptance of cash instead of the customary Samoan exchange goods such as '_ie toga_ (fine mats) caused him to be accused of commercializing Samoan _tatau_. This is despite cash being used in many other forms of Samoan ceremonial exchange. Paulo was also criticized for his tattooing of non-Samoans, particularly later in his career. Significantly, in 1979–80 Paulo tattooed a well-known New Zealand painter Tony Fomison, with his close Samoan friend Fuimaono Tuiasau (see Brunt, this volume).[40](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-40) But it was when his connections to other tattooists in the international tattooing community increased that his tattooing of non-Samoans became a concern to Samoan community leaders and commentators.

Sulu'ape Paulo was a controversial figure because aspects of his practice (particularly the tattooing of non-Samoans) were seen by Samoan community leaders and _matai_ as devaluing an ancient and important custom. Among some Samoans in New Zealand there is a strong sense that a distinctive part of Samoan society and culture will be lost to them. In an interview in 1999 Su'a Sulu'ape Paulo explained to me that he did not share this concern. He considered the _tatau_ something the wearer could not exchange or sell, something that is with the wearer for life. He assumed that, to receive the _pe'a_, the recipient must have some respect for its history, values and aesthetic. He therefore had no problem taking _tatau_ to the world and sharing it with other tattooing enthusiasts.

Despite Paulo's position and sentiment, a nationalist and traditionalist view exists in Samoan society relating to who has authority over Samoan tattooing. Among some Samoan _matai_ in New Zealand and Samoa, there is a deep sense of ownership over _tatau_ and in particular the _pe'a_. When non-Samoans are tattooed, a custom Samoans feel they have some authority over slips beyond their influence and control. Even within the Sa Su'a there are conflicting views relating to whether or not nonSamoans should be tattooed with the _pe'a_. Su'a Sulu'ape Paulo was very much involved in these debates and he was defiant in the face of extreme pressure. Despite the debates, however, the directions that _tatau_ practices have taken, and the many global manifestations of Samoan _tatau_ on non-Samoan skins, the _pe'a_ retains a special significance among New Zealand-based Samoans. While it retains some continuity with past practices in its communal role, it also has a role in shaping the individual. The service and skills of the _soga'imiti_ (tattooed male) remain crucial to completing formal Samoan meetings and ceremonials. But how and why individuals 'wear' their _pe'a_ and the personal meanings they attach to the tattooing process and its resulting imagery is also important.

Similarly the significance of the _malu_ – the female form of Samoan _tatau_ – is being renegotiated. This is in contrast to earlier ethnographic accounts, in which it hardly rated a mention, was not categorized as _tatau_[41](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-41) and was seen almost solely as a learning opportunity for apprentices.[42](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-42) Times have changed, so have attitudes, and the role of women in Samoan society. Partsch's study of 1993 of _malu_ among Samoan women in New Zealand highlighted a range of attitudes to the wearing of the _malu_ and its acceptance by the church and the wider community. Her research indicates that the church still exerts some pressure on young Samoans not to be tattooed, because it is seen as 'a spilling of blood' and a means to achieve 'self-glory'. Even so, there is strong resistance to this rule, despite fines and the threat of temporary disassociation. The _malu_ was seen by some to be 'a personal sacrifice and an outward symbol and acknowledgement of how they feel about their fa'asamoa and cultural identity'.[43](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-43) This study also highlighted a trend for older Samoan women in their late forties and fifties to acquire the _malu_, raising questions about the relevance of _malu_ to this generation in their youth, and supporting O'Meara's earlier observations.

Non-Samoan women also receive the _malu_ and I have met one European woman with a full _malu_ and several with only elements of it. This 'sampling' of _tatau_ motifs is common. During the South Pacific Arts Festival in Samoa in 1996, I witnessed a Peace Corps Volunteer being tattooed with the _malu_ motif on the rear of her leg just behind the knee. The various ways that parts of the _malu_ can be isolated as interesting elements in themselves make them attractive to people who collect tattoos and want something quickly.

Today _tatau_ is rendered in tattooing conventions, art galleries and festivals, as well as in private homes. In the global context there are many ways to negotiate and pay for the _tatau_. The customs involved and methods vary, as do the income and access to resources possessed by the customer. For example, young New Zealand-born Samoans do not often have access to customary Samoan exchange items such as '_ie toga_ (fine mats). In many cases cash is the most practical currency and a readily acceptable substitute. The cost of a _pe'a_ in New Zealand starts at around $1,800–$2,000. As with most commercial transactions, one can expect to get what one pays for. In theory, the more one pays, the better the quality of the work. In some situations, _fa'asamoa_ (Samoan custom) prevails when negotiating and paying for the _pe'a_. Cash payments, the gifting of pigs, '_ie toga_ and _siapo_ (bark-cloth) become part of the transaction and are divided and distributed by the _tufuga_ among his helpers.

Outside the usual Samoan social contexts, information about _tatau_ is most widely disseminated through literature, film and photographic representations. Increasingly the Internet has become an effective tool for documenting and distributing information about tattooing.[44](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-44) In published sources such as books and magazines, _tufuga_ have (mainly through interviews) given various accounts of what the _pe'a_ and _tatau_ mean. Two important historical sources on Samoan tattooing are Augustin Kramer's _The Samoan Islands_ and Carl Marquardt's _The Tattooing of both Sexes in Samoa_.[45](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-45) Both books from Germany, originally published at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, are based on or include firsthand accounts from _tufuga_ and tattooed Samoans Their popularity has seen them translated into English and republished. Today they circulate as the standard references on Samoan tattooing. Nineteenth-century ethnographic sources such as these are often the only way that tattooing enthusiasts in Europe, for example, can access Samoan _tatau_ imagery and accounts. I have interviewed tattooed Europeans who mention the importance of these sources time and time again. Increasingly, other sources for information on Samoan tattooing include magazine articles and generalist books on body art and the art of the Pacific.

Tattooing magazines that have featured Samoan _tatau_ include the United States-based _TattooTime_ and _Skin and Ink_ and recent articles include submissions from Pacific tattooing practitioners reporting on current events. The main market for tattooing magazines is the Western tattooing milieu, and while individual magazines do not have a wide circulation, their combined total readership is considered to be quite significant. Today, popular tattooing literature as well as older historic and ethnographic accounts keeps images and stories of Samoan _tatau_ circulating globally. As published interviews with, and articles about, _tufuga_ circulate, they shape wider understandings about _tatau_ history, meaning and significance.

As the popularity of _tatau_ has grown, its presence has increased in other forms of media such as television, film and literature. For example, the Samoan authors Albert Wendt and Sia Figiel have used the imagery of _tatau_ to speak to wider issues of cultural change,[46](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-46) and filmmakers have focused their lenses on the lines and lives of tattooed Samoans.[47](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-47) In contemporary media representations _tatau_ has become emblematic of the Samoan nation and culture; for example, in 2002 a series of phone cards from Samoa featured images of _tatau_, and tourist brochures and calendars from Samoa often feature tattooed Samoan men and women. An American tattooist who wears the _pe'a_ describes his first glimpse of the _tatau_ on a travel brochure as a major discovery:

It was an epiphany, I mean it led directly to the path for me to get my own pe'a and to my own title and to my own path of traditional [tattooing]. The first time I saw a Samoan pe'a, was on a travel brochure, literally. I saw this obscure image that was peaking out from under something and a guy in the background, it wasn't even the featured picture, there was something in there . . . what is that . . . what? Look at that tattoo, look at that pattern! . . . it was just a little bit of the inner thigh that was showing.

Apart from the promotional materials and agendas of tourist markets and marketers, Samoan _tufuga_ themselves are proactive users of technology and media to publicize and disseminate information about their work. An Australian-based _tufuga_ often uses the Internet to educate and generate discussion about Samoan _tatau_. Sulu'ape Uili Tasi runs two websites to support the work of Su'a Sulu'ape Petelo. An example was the registration for the Second International _Tatau_ Convention in Samoa in 2001, which was distributed via the Internet. He is also a regular correspondent (under pseudonym) on the _Samoa Sensation_ website, where there is an e-mail posting section where visitors to the site post questions relating to Samoan history and culture. A topic that frequently comes up is _tatau_. Sulu'ape Uili Tasi uses the site to answer questions, explain the meanings of _tatau_, and direct people to specific events and the location of other _tufuga_. As well as the sites that Sulu'ape Uili Tasi administers, there are many other Internet sites that feature Samoan tattooing histories; most notably the _Tattoo History Source Book_ (http://tattoos.com/jane/steve/index.htm). These sources for information on Samoan _tatau_ have the potential to distribute a range of meanings on _tatau_ and multiply the diversity of those meanings. They are crucial parts of the mediascape that _tatau_ circulates within. The use of the Internet is an example of how _tufuga_ are able to distribute information about Samoan _tatau_ to the world, but also how they attempt to fix and control its dissemination.

### THE INSTALLATION OF SULU'APE FAMILY TITLES AT LEFAGA, SAMOA, 2001

If there is one event that ruptures the stereotype of _tatau_ as unchanging, and Samoa as its single locus of production, it is a _saofa'i_ (title bestowal) that took place during the Second International _Tatau_ Convention in Samoa in 2001. The title bestowal was held at this time to take advantage of the title-holders' attendance at the convention. I was invited to attend by one of the Maori participants in the tattooing convention that was taking place simultaneously at another village. He would receive the Sulu'ape tattooing title from the Sulu'ape family in the village of Lefaga, and was one of several non-Samoan tattooists to receive the title that day.

On the morning of the _saofa'i_, we drove to the family property in Lefaga, where we awaited the arrival of the village _matai_. The title recipients were ushered to a small nearby _fale_ and dressed by people from the '_aiga_ in long pieces of '_ie palagi_ (printed cloth) and rubbed down with oil. Stripped to the waist, with flower garlands draped around their necks, the recipients of the title were a Frenchman, a Dutchman, a Samoan, an American, a Hawaiian and a New Zealand Maori (illus. 91). Others present were to receive the Pasina title that is closely related to the Su'a tattooing clan. What the new title-holders all had in common was their profession as tattooists and a shared connection to Su'a Sulu'ape Paulo and Su'a Sulu'ape Petelo. Most had met the brothers during their international travels and had received instruction from them in the use of Samoan tattooing tools.

Once they were dressed, the prospective _tufuga_ moved into the _faletele_, the main house on the property. Waiting there for them were the _matai_ of the village of Lefaga. The prospects were made to sit in the centre of the _fale_ and formalities were begun that would incorporate them into the Sulu'ape family. The symbolic handing over of the titles came at a price. The recipients made substantial cash gifts to the title owners. The family in return presented _to'oto'o_ (ceremonial staffs) and _fue_ (ceremonial flywhisks), the status symbols of _tulafale_ (orator chiefs). After speeches, the bestowal took place, in front of an audience that included locals as well as friends and family of the new _matai_.

As I have already mentioned, historical accounts of the apprentice/guild arrangement indicate that the specialist arts and trades of Samoa are long established; therefore a social structure is already in place in Samoan society that enables new apprentices or agents to be incorporated into the Sulu'ape family of the '_aiga_ Sa Su'a.[48](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-48) The bestowal was an initiative conceived by Paulo several years prior to his sudden death in 1999. Despite some opposition within the family and village, his brother Su'a Sulu'ape Petelo decided to see the initiative through to completion. With the exception of one participant, all were students of Paulo. The remainder was a student of Petelo. According to Sulu'ape Petelo, the bestowal of the Sulu'ape title gave the recipients the right to tattoo others using the Samoan tattooing tools, but in their own specific cultural styles. It was not a licence to tattoo _pe'a_. It appears, however, that this intention has never been communicated widely and has resulted in various responses from the new Sulu'ape title-holders.

Regardless of the original intentions, there are several reasons why this particular bestowal of Sulu'ape titles to foreigners might be beneficial not only to the newly installed _tufuga_ and the Sulu'ape family but the Sa Su'a as a whole. First, the bestowal of the titles creates agents or apprentices for the Sa Su'a in a range of communities overseas. This assures access to different markets and clients for _tatau_. Second, an international distribution of members of the Sa Su'a keeps _tatau_ prominent in the conventions and tattoo shows in the areas in which they are located. This develops and helps to service an existing client base, one that is not only interested in the markings but in having images created with the tools themselves. Third, while the scatter of _tufuga_ around the globe makes the _tatau_ more prominent, it also provides the Sa Su'a (intentionally or unintentionally) with a sense of control over who appropriates, uses and renders Samoan designs overseas. Prospective clients are probably more likely to approach an authorized tattoo artist to produce Samoan designs than not, especially if an 'authentic' motif and the experience of tattooing under the '_au_ is sought after. Fourth, these _tatau_ agents also serve potentially to reduce the demands on the Samoan based _tufuga_. The newly installed California based _tufuga_ Sulu'ape Freewind has said that when Su'a Sulu'ape Petelo visited there for the Long Beach Tattoo Convention in the 1990s he was swamped by the number of people who wanted some tattooing work from him. Having a member of the Sa Su'a in California may ensure that to some extent client demand is met. Now operating under the Sulu'ape title, Freewind believes he may eventually have permission to produce Samoan _tatau_ in a region where there is a substantial Samoan community. As he explained, Petelo wanted him to have the title eventually enabling him to,

tattoo the hundred and thirty thousand Samoans that live in California alone . . . there is going to be so many people that won't be able to wait, or be able to travel to Samoa or be able to wait for him to come . . . and even if they did, he is only one man that can't do them all, . . . he wants me to help take on the responsibility of learning the pe'a and giving the pe'a to the Samoan population that is there . . .[49](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-49)

In Europe, this type of arrangement does not seem to be in place – or at least there is a different kind of understanding – with the responsibility and privileges of the title considered differently. The newly installed _tufuga_ Sulu'ape Michel, who also works as a tribal art dealer in the Netherlands, is not actively seeking opportunities to do work in the Samoan style. He has completed one _pe'a_ on a European that was started by Su'a Sulu'ape Paulo, but he does not plan to pursue Samoan _tatau_ work further. I interviewed him six months after receiving the title. At that point he was of the view that the family title was not necessarily a licence to practise _tatau_ abroad or claim some kind of authority over Samoan _tatau_. He said:

To me it seemed it was an honorary thing. Each one of us had done something for Samoan _tatau_ or traditional tattoo . . . there are persons [title-holders in the group] who hardly have anything Samoan on them who carry the title . . . If I go to Samoa I will never introduce myself as Sulu'ape Michel. Because I might be shaking hands with Malietoa so and so. By introducing myself as Sulu'ape I bring relations to such a high level of protocol that I would make a fool of myself because I don't know this level. So I think it is something that people can only say of me to other people, and then I can be the clown and say that it is an honorary thing, its not the same as you and your title. So I think that there is really a misunderstanding of what happened [at the bestowal].[50](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-50)

What long-term implications the recent introduction of these non-Samoans to the Sulu'ape family and Sa Su'a tattooing fraternity will have is difficult to predict. The main point I want to make is that some Samoan _tufuga_ who claim authority or sovereignty over the arts of _tatau_ are seeking to share it with the wider world. They are active agents in its dissemination and dispersal. This suggests a certain amount of confidence in the understanding of the people they are entrusting with their family title and knowledge. It also indicates that some _tufuga_ sense that the skills and knowledge of _tatau_ may be lost if not shared. What will be interesting to observe in future is the extent to which the Samoan communities accept some of these non-Samoan members of the Sa Su'a that some are claiming they are permitted to serve, as well as how they are viewed by the other families in the Sa Su'a. The same is true in regard to the acceptance and recognition of the _tufuga_ among the Western tattoo community. Will these non-Samoan _tufuga_ be seen as experts and authorities in Samoan _tatau_? Will they meet clients' expectations and perceptions of what a _tufuga tatatau_ is and can be? On a day-to-day basis the new title-holders will not move in the Samoan social circles where the Sulu'ape title will have most relevance. But they will find relevance for the title wherever they choose to put it to work, whether this is in the European tattooing convention circuit or in a tattoo shop in a Los Angeles suburb. And in this respect the titles not only serve the cause of the Sa Su'a or Sulu'ape family, but potentially the ambitions or desires of the individual title-holders in their own communities and social contexts.

Within the Sa Su'a extended family some members who are _tufuga tatatau_ do not approve of the bestowal of Sulu'ape title to non-Samoans, or the gifting of tools and what may seem like a licence for non-Samoans to tattoo _pe'a_ and _malu_. It is, however, significant that the only challenge made in relation to this history-making bestowal related to one of Samoan recipients and his right to receive the Sulu'ape title and not to the rights of the non-Samoan titleholders. This title dispute went before the Samoan courts in 2003 and was granted in favour of the recipient.[51](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-51) And this raises an interesting point, and that is that the granting of these privileges to non-Samoans is probably no more threat to traditionalist views of Samoan tattooing and culture than granting them to Samoan people only. Remember that Samoan _tufuga_ themselves have historically been and still are significant transgressors of 'tradition' or _fa'asamoa_. The most strenuously contested innovations or changes in contemporary Samoan tattooing practice have been instigated by Samoans. And as they continue to travel globally they will continue to adapt their practice to new environments, situations and client demands.

In terms of the title bestowal alone, there are several, co-existing and in some aspects conflicting perspectives of what the event was about. It was not universally accepted by the family, or by other families in the tattooing clan, and was criticized by _matai_ in Samoa and New Zealand.[52](19_Reference.xhtml#ref7-52) What is not widely known is the original intention behind the bestowal and the efforts to inform and share tattooing technology, ensuring its survival and perhaps developing some sense of fellowship. And this is the paradox. Just when circumstances are set up to take hold of _tatau_, fix its meaning and stabilize or control its dissemination and relevance, it somehow slips away and moves in a new direction.

### CONCLUSION

In November 2002 I was talking on the telephone to Sulu'ape Uili Tasi who was working with Su'a Sulu'ape Petelo in Hawaii. I had spent a great deal of time trying to track the _tufuga_ down. I found out that they had already been to Hawaii in July and August when they completed nine _pe'a_ in six weeks. They were currently back in Hawaii doing three more and in a nice throwback to their ancestors they were working on a Tongan, tattooing and reconstructing on him a Tongan version of a _pe'a_ based on a rare drawing from the nineteenth century. They were then booked to travel to the United States for a week, up to Sweden for a few days, then to Berlin for a convention, then another in Malmö and finally back to Samoa. All in less than five weeks. I could hardly keep up with what the _tufuga_ was telling me. So how do we keep up with what they are doing and the way _tatau_ is changing as it circulates and is inscribed on bodies oceans apart?

The Samoan tattooing history I have outlined is fragmented but cohesive enough to allow some general conclusions to be made. From the first settlers of Samoa and their shared 'Lapita' culture, to the tattooing of non-Samoans and Samoans internationally, Samoan tattooing can be considered a contested practice. Samoan _tatau_ was contested within the islands of Samoa and reinterpreted to suit the circumstances of the skins it was on. Historically, local and trans-local forces of change have shaped Samoan _tatau_. I have argued that inter-island connections, processes of colonization and new and conflicting ideologies locate Samoa at the convergence of forces of change from beyond its shores. However, the changes and contestations were not always externally imposed: Samoans were active agents in response to these outside influences. In the nineteenth century their persistence ensured the survival of _tatau_ in the face of a conflicting and powerful ideology. While external forces were an impetus for change, the internal politics among _tufuga_ of older and younger generations and the banning of _tatau_ in some villages and not others, demonstrates that _tatau_ and its associated practices, like the society in which it is embedded, was not homogenous. The meaning and social relevance of _tatau_ were locally and diversely negotiated in response to local and non-local influences. What these accounts present us with is a more complicated history of _tatau_ and an insight into how a single cultural production can be variously interpreted, even within one archipelago.

Today the circumstances of history and the stories from folklore may lead the tattooing families to assume that they alone have ownership and authority over _tatau_. But the reality is that the visible and distinctive profile of _tatau_ makes it an attractive and important cultural icon in the status politics of Samoan _matai_ and the social elite. Moreover, outside Samoan social and cultural situations, _tatau_ is important to non-Samoans, who also play an influential role in its dissemination and reproduction. Today, the circulation of _tatau_ outside the Samoan social contexts is more obvious in an era where visual culture is more accessible and moves quickly on global cultural flows via the Internet, television and other mass media. Social actors with access to these sources appropriate and create ideas around symbols to suit their own desires and realities. What is not so new about these processes is that they have been taking place for centuries. Anthropologists have recognized this for some time, but what is new is the intensity of these processes in the present day, and the importance of understanding how these processes converge and create diversity.

The present-day tensions over the ownership of _tatau_ and its practice are a result of a heightened awareness of global 'cultural flows'. There is anxiety among some Samoans of _tatau_ becoming devalued or losing significance in a seemingly overwhelming tide of westernization. What this history of Samoan _tatau_ illuminates is how, despite its increasingly global practice, _tatau_ still persists in expressing a very local (albeit transnational/diasporic) set of identities and experiences for Samoan people.# CHAPTER TEN

## Beyond Modern Primitivism

Cyril Siorat

Ever since the needles have entered my skin and the ink has settled, the existential dimension of tattooing has been clear to me. Born in France, I moved to Moorea, in French Polynesia, aged 20. There I became a friend of Chime, a Marquesan tattoo artist. During my first year-long stay, Chime gave me three tattoos of Marquesan design. It was thirteen years, and several tattoos, later that I started to study the practice officially as an anthropologist. It was then that I became fully acquainted with the literature on tattoo milieux and with the academic debate regarding them. One of the main critiques of contemporary neo-tribal tattooing identifies this subculture under the rubric of 'modern primitive', and suggests that its practice reproduces old primitivist ideas. However, many of those involved today in body modification do not identify themselves in these terms and, although it is important to acknowledge that the wider spectrum of contemporary 'tribal' references does, almost inevitably, include neoprimitivist understandings, the milieux at present are too diverse to be reduced to what is, in fact, a reductionist critique. I argue that the 'modern primitive' label has been seized upon by commentators who have not considered how aptly it captures the contemporary practices, personal histories and motivations of the protagonists, and the ways that these have changed since the publication of the now notorious anthology _Modern Primitives_ in 1989.[1](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-1) This chapter attempts to rebut the critique, in particular through a consideration of the commodification of tattoos. I defend the contemporary movement from the charge that it is embedded above all in normative definitions of consumer culture.

Since the publication of _Modern Primitives_ in 1989 by the alternative arts press Re/Search,[2](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-2) there has been some discussion among social scientists regarding the identity and motivations of European and American individuals involved in the body modification movement. One of the main criticisms has been that such movements are involved in the facile idealization of the exotic 'Other'. In consequence, so the argument goes, they perpetuate classic primitivist assumptions. Modern primitives are, according to Klesse, a 'legacy of colonialism in late imperial culture'.[3](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-3) It is easy to feel confused about the identity of 'modern primitives', considering the multiple networks of which the tattoo community is formed. It seems that if there is such a thing as a 'modern primitive' movement, it is likely to be localized, on the west coast of the USA, and within the context of a network evolving around particular individuals such as Fakir Musafar. In London, home to a dynamic body modification community, I am still to find someone who would define her or himself as a 'modern primitive'. I am not suggesting that people in London were not inspired by the _Modern Primitives_ publication, and subsequent work in that field, but that the identity marker 'modern primitive' seems to be almost always assigned by non-body modifier individuals, 'in the know', rather than used as a self-expression of identity.

Rather than being rigid and inflexible, individual and group identities have always been involved in a constant dialectical process involving the other, as both the Polynesian revival and the changing global tattoo community shows. 'Individual identity is located within a two-way social process, an interaction of "ego" and "other", inside and outside. It is in the meeting of internal and external definition that identity, whether collective or individual, is created'.[4](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-4) Therefore, 'identification is never a unilateral process; at the very least there is always an audience'.[5](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-5) In that sense, publications from the 'modern primitive' movement could be regarded as internal definition, while academic work scrutinizing them is an external definition.

I would argue, however, that both should be conceptualized as external to the multiple body modification networks and to the individuals involved in these networks. Different features of these external definitions will coincide or differ from the internal definition of the individuals involved in body modification practices, giving rise either to negative or positive confirmation of the perceived internal identity. Therefore, considering that identification processes are constant, social scientists should be careful not to assign the label 'modern primitive' to any individual involved in body modification and who refers in some way or another to 'tribalism' or to an urge to modify their bodies.

Another aspect of the 'modern primitive' publications and term is that they are ironic. There is an awareness that nobody can be a 'primitive', hence the addition of 'modern' to the term, and that the association of these two terms collapses a popular dichotomy. These publications are important media of self-promotion and self-expression rather than academically sanctioned arguments. Many of the contributors to _Modern Primitives_,[6](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-6) do not refer to themselves as 'modern primitives' but share some sensibilities with some aspects of the agenda of this particular network. Therefore caution should be applied when categorizing such networks, and one should be aware of the danger of objectifying the Other and denouncing such processes in the past while, at the same time, participating in current categorization of 'others'. Furthermore, I do not believe that irony invalidates personal narratives and embodied experiences as scholars such as Turner seem to imply.[7](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-7) If the ironists always hold their views of the world in doubt,[8](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-8) it is because, as Beck argues:

Doubt . . . which not only serves science but now, applied reflexively, disrupts and destroys the latter's false and fragile clarities and pseudo-certainties, could become the standard for a new modernity which starts from the principles of precaution and reversibility. Contrary to a widespread mistake, doubt makes everything – science, knowledge, criticism and morality – possible once again, only different, a couple of sizes smaller, more tentative, personal, colourful and open to social learning. Hence it is also more curious, more open to things that are contrary, unsuspected and incompatible, and all this with the tolerance that is based in the ultimate final certainty of error.[9](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-9)

The term 'modern primitive' was coined by an individual called Fakir Musafar in the late 1970s to describe himself and a few other people who were following a similar personal path. Born in 1930, Fakir Musafar has been a pioneer in the practice of body modification, such as piercing and branding, and has been involved in modifying his body for the last 50 years. Now called 'the father of modern primitivism', Fakir Musafar spent a great time experimenting in secret. 'Unfortunately, I was driven into deep isolation and shame . . . for lack of any social sanction . . . I knew that if I let it be known what I felt and what I was doing, I would probably have been institutionalised'.[10](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-10) This led him to find, in past and present painful rituals from around the world, some form of sanction. He found social sanction in the fact that body modification behaviours were deemed acceptable, and often desirable, in diverse human cultures. In a way, this yearning for social sanction of types of behaviour considered too deviant in mainstream Western society could be interpreted as a plea for inclusion rather than exclusion. Body modification, then, could be seen not as a rebellious act but a confirmation of one's alterity. This is also a form of resistance but not a conflictual one.

Resistance has often been understood as a binary opposite of domination. However, if power is dispersed, multiple and relational, as Foucault argues, then resistance must also be diffuse, decentred – an integral part of power rather than its opposite. As Rosenblatt points out, resistance does not mean activities that 'escape existing systems of meaning';[11](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-11) acts are inevitably formed in relation to the society from whence they come. He argues that so-called 'modern primitives' position themselves in a conflictual opposition to capitalist consumption and Christianity when in fact their beliefs reflect certain Christian ideas about the relationship of the individual self to society.[12](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-12) I would disagree with Rosenblatt's assertion that modern primitives' own view is necessarily simplistically conflictual; it can also be seen as a plea for an inclusion of alterity within mainstream society.

This plea could also be perceived as a demand, a demand that the boundaries of what is civilized and what is primitive be collapsed into an ironic, contrary and problematic statement. Nonetheless, it is true that the discourse of Fakir Musafar reifies some popular Western primitive conceptions that are grounded in colonial discourse and gaze, as Klesse argues.[13](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-13) It is also true that a lot of tattoo artists and tattooed individuals do have fairly naïve and simplistic ideas about what tribal tattoos represent and what a Euro-American person becomes by taking them on. In that sense, Rosenblatt is right to argue that most references to primitive in the West have more to do with a perceived lost social sense of the self, of Euro-American individuals, than with any non-Western cultures.[14](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-14) It is, however, also important to note that the Western concept of the primitive has sometimes been taken as an identity marker by colonized populations themselves. Furthermore, the tattoo and body modification milieu is heterogeneous. There seems to be a gulf between an individual who is getting a pseudo tribal tattoo in Europe, in the absence of much knowledge of its origins and meanings, and who probably holds a fairly naïve set of New Age motivations, and the smaller network of people who are more actively part of a genuinely cross-cultural community, and who are engaged in something different from consumerist appropriation.

In California in the early 1970s Fakir Musafar went public and gave a performance of ritual piercing in a tattoo convention. From then on, his experimentation with body modification influenced and inspired different sub-cultural networks, sado-masochism (S&M) and punk, for example. That Musafar chose to give his first public performance at an event organized by the tattoo community is indicative of the strength of the tattooing networks at that time. From the 1960s onwards, as Benson argues, the tattoo community went through great changes 'increasing international communication, technical innovation and the work of a number of key individuals, many from art school backgrounds, radically transformed the possibilities of the medium'.[15](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-15) Through the 1980s an increasing interest developed among some tattoo artists for traditional tattoo designs from places where a tattoo tradition had been, or was still part of the cultural array of symbolic expressions. By the late 1980s the work of the Filipino-American tattoo artist Leo Zulueta, among a few others, became an inspiration worldwide in the development of such styles, and although he appears in the publication _Modern Primitives_, he does not refer to himself as one.[16](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-16) His work does not entail an underlying desire to be the 'Other'. Rather, he equates his research into traditional designs as conservation of an aesthetic tradition: 'all the old men having "primitive"-style tattoos are dead. . . . The last man to have a back piece like mine, who was over ninety years old, passed away a couple of years ago. This is why I really feel strongly about preserving those ancient designs'.[17](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-17) He also acknowledges the possibility that the 'original' meanings of these designs may never be understood in the contemporary setting. His work does not, however, entail a conservation of the designs in the butterfly collector's manner. They are preserved on their original medium, the human skin. It would also seem that for some tattooists, at least, the search is not for a mythical primitive 'Other' but for themselves. Leo Zulueta, for example, is half Filipino and grew up in Hawaii, suggesting perhaps that the inner motivations of body modifiers are complex, varied, and often rooted in personal cross-cultural biographies rather than mono-dimensional ones.

While the 'neo-tribal/black work' tattoo styles were developing momentum in North America and Europe, other tattoo communities were also involved in major evolutions. Tattooing was a prominent procedure throughout Polynesia, before its colonization. In French Polynesia, for example, Christian missions and the colonial authorities stopped the practice of tattooing for more than a century. Since the late 1970s, however, tattooing has been revived by Ma'ohi (native Polynesian) cultural agents (traditional dance troupes and other artists). It is now highly visible and a growing aspect of the local tourist industry. The traditional Tahitian and Marquesan designs that are tattooed today in French Polynesia are also important cultural and social identity markers (see Kuwahara, this volume).

During the last fifteen years, Ma'ohi tattoo artists have themselves been influenced and inspired by different cultural tattoo designs and styles, including Samoan and also North American and European 'black work'. Polynesian tattooists also became regular guests at tattoo conventions in North America and Europe. They forged strong relationships and created global networks with 'tribal' practitioners. A great influence throughout the 1990s was that of the late Paulo Sulu'ape from Western Samoa, where there has been a continuity of practice throughout the colonial and post-colonial periods (see Mallon, this volume). Sulu'ape introduced many tattooists to traditional methods of tattooing and inspired many others by communicating the meanings and context of the Samoan designs he tattooed in many non-Samoan skins. In Tahiti, however, it is paradoxical that the forms and meanings of contemporary Ma'ohi tattoos are reconstructed from representations produced by explorers and colonial agents in the nineteenth century. In my view, 'authentic' Ma'ohi tattooists are therefore involved in a similar process of recontextualizing symbols as are the 'inauthentic' so-called modern primitives.

## TATTOOS AND COMMODIFICATION

At this point, I would like to explore the involvement of tattoos in consumer culture since it is often used as a challenge to their authenticity. Through this discussion, I intend to develop further some of the points raised in this introductory section. It has been argued that tattoos, and body modifications in general, 'do not escape commodification',[18](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-18) that they 'can be purchased for money like other commodities'[19](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-19) and should 'be interpreted in the context of an increasingly trendy aestheticization and commodification of ethnic difference'.[20](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-20) On the other hand, it has also been argued that body modifications 'differ from other "free-floating" commodities, not only because of their status as permanent or "semi-permanent" modifications to the body, but also because of the necessary physicality of their production'[21](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-21) and the pain that accompanies such practices.[22](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-22) The permanent aspect of tattoos render them 'the ultimate' in anti-fashion.[23](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-23) In other words, there are two views regarding tattoos and commodity. The first is that tattoos have been commoditized. Anyone can walk into a tattoo shop, choose a design, pay and come out with a new tattoo. The socio-cultural context of the design is irrelevant; it could be argued that the tattoo as a product is alienated. The second perspective considers tattoos to be potent anti-commodity symbols due to their non-exchangeability, their permanence and their personal nature. Although divergent, these two views do not contradict each other since they both focus on different times in the biography of a tattoo. There is a popular belief in Western culture that things are either commodities or are not. At one pole are things that 'represent the natural universe of commodities' and 'at the opposite pole we place people, who represent the natural universe of individuation and singularization'.[24](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-24) However, this is a relatively recent dichotomy.

Works by Appadurai[25](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-25) and Thomas[26](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-26) emphasize, in their respective definitions of commodities, the importance of context. Appadurai suggests that 'commodity . . . refers to things that, at a certain _phase_ in their careers and in a particular _context_, meet the requirements of commodity candidacy'.[27](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-27) The commodity candidacy here is understood to mean 'the standards and criteria that define the exchangeability of things in any particular social and historical context'.[28](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-28) Anything, therefore, can become a commodity in the time of its existence as long as it meets the candidacy requirements of its context. When things do not meet the commodity candidacy, they become singular and have reached a different phase in their status. Thomas presents commodities 'as objects, persons, or elements of persons, which are placed in a context in which they have exchange value and can be alienated. The alienation of a thing is its dissociation from producers, former users, or prior context'.[29](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-29) The alienability of things or persons is crucial to their status as commodities. If such dissociation cannot be attained, objects may become 'artefacts which tell a story'.[30](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-30) Furthermore Kopytoff's definition of commodities emphasizes the importance of the discrete nature of the exchange. This is 'in order to stress that the primary and immediate purpose of the transaction is to obtain the counterpart value'.[31](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-31) This is in contrast to gift exchanges where rules of relations of reciprocity should apply. At this point, however, it should be made clear that commodity exchange is not a feature of modern societies and gift exchange a feature of traditional societies. Both systems seem to exist, to varying degrees of popularity, in all human societies. The root of the commodity seems to lie in the action of exchange. Exchange, being at the root of human social life and a universal feature of it, makes commodities a universal aspect of culture.[32](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-32) The commodity status is therefore a flexible one; a phase in a biography, and commoditization a 'process of becoming'.[33](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-33) The commodity must be alienable from its origins and its exchange does not entail any further obligations or expectations. Moreover, there seems to be a constant conflictual relationship between the drive to extend the arena of commodity exchange, and widen the range of available commodity items, and a human need for the singularization of particular items or range of items. The former is inherent to the exchange technology, while the latter is motivated by individuality and culture.[34](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-34)

The rise, in the nineteenth century, of new exchange technologies[35](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-35) and of a materialist culture and new types of consumption, avid of products from all over the world,[36](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-36) was instrumental to a rapid expansion of the process of commoditization and, in turn, to the capitalist system. Appadurai,[37](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-37) quoting the work of Sombart, links this new type of consumption to the demands of the bourgeois and nobility classes for luxury goods. Luxuries should not be regarded as the opposite of necessities but rather as 'goods whose principal use is rhetorical and social, goods that are simply incarnated signs'.[38](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-38) Luxuries are part of a particular register of consumption rather than a special class of things.[39](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-39) Similarly, I would propose that tattoos are also part of a particular register of consumption. I do not want to argue that tattoos are luxury items reserved for the elites, but rather that they represent incarnated signs for marginal communities; a luxurious symbol of otherness.

There are five main attributes that should be displayed by incarnated signs as commodities. These are restriction to elites, complexity of acquisition, semiotic virtuosity, regulation by fashion, and 'a high degree of linkage of their consumption to body, person, and personality'.[40](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-40) While tattoos would not have to display all of these attributes to qualify as an incarnated sign involved in a particular register of consumption, I would argue that they do. Take, for example, the criterion of restriction to elites: although it is clear that they are not restricted to an elite _per se_, until recently their access was restricted to certain groups of people. Today, even if the restriction seems to have been removed to an extent, tattoos still have a certain degree of difficulty of access. To start with, tattoo artists' rates are not cheap. Another restriction can be the painful nature of the tattooing process, which may not appeal to all. And finally the prospective tattooee may consider the social restrictions imposed on future social interactions based on pre-conceptions of tattoos – for example, difficulty in finding employment. When the production technology of incarnated signs becomes more advanced and able to produce these articles in increased numbers and at a lower price, they become more accessible to anyone and therefore lose their restriction attribute.[41](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-41) This shift, from different spheres of exchange value, seems to manifest itself as a shift from issues of exclusivity to issues of authenticity.[42](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-42) I would like to propose that a similar shift has happened in the tattoo world.

Up to three decades ago, tattoos were mainly acquired by marginal groups. These were, in the West, soldiers, sailors, criminals and people involved in body modification, such as tattoo artists themselves. Most incarnated signs symbolized belonging to particular groups and/or the partaking of particular activities, for example, military regiments, port of calls, time in jail and allegiance to a pimp. Tattoos were the quasi-exclusivity of these groups. However, in the last fifteen years, tattoos have become part of popular culture. They are used in advertising campaigns to portray, among other things, sexual attractiveness. There has been an invasion, of the high streets in the West, of roses, dolphins, yin & yang, and other small tattoos. I would argue that the exclusivity of tattoos was threatened by a shift towards a perceived common, or more mainstream, sphere of exchange value. The shift from different spheres of exchange value moved, similarly to the one mentioned above, from issues of exclusivity to issues of authenticity, or rather here of authenticities. The first authenticity I am referring to has to do with authenticity of commitment. It could be argued that as small tattoos became more popular, people involved in the body modification movement had to engage more extensively with these embodied incarnated signs. Bigger tattoos and body-suits, as well as extensive piercings, became a way to authenticate this commitment, one sign of this exclusivity being tattoos that cannot be hidden by clothes. The second authenticity has to do with the origin and process of tattooing itself.

As I noted earlier, an important aspect of the tattoo revival is the tribal and traditional styles and the tattoo artists involved in this style. Designs used as tattoos can be found worldwide and, in the late 1970s and '80s, some Western tattoo artists started to use some of these designs as inspirations (for the longevity of this process of exchange and innovation, see Mallon, this volume). However, the cultural context of such design was mainly unrelated to its use in tattoo shops; the designs were alienated and therefore commoditized. However, some individuals involved in this revival wanted artefacts, designs that told stories, rather than alienated commodities, and travelled to encounter and engage with the places of origin of some of these designs. Oceania was one of the instrumental locations of these encounters. Authenticity became a question of context. Context includes here both the place in which, and the person from whom, one will get a tribal or traditional tattoo. Similar designs tattooed in Cardiff by a home-based tattoo artist; in London by a renowned tribal tattoo artist; in Auckland by a Maori tattoo artist; and in Madrid at a tattoo convention by a mixed race Polynesian tattoo artist with traditional tools all have greatly different degrees of authenticity.

It has been argued that 'traditional Maori . . . signs are woven into global consumerism, where they are endlessly modernised, producing a complex hybridisation of signs and messages'.[43](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-43) Rather than equating the presence of Maori tattoos with a destructive modernization, however, the development of the 'neo-tribal', also called 'black work', can be perceived as another period in that style. By this I mean that there can be no exact replicas of something. However rigid and static a ritual, a style or a practice may be to the outside observer, however rooted in tradition they may seem, the enactment will always be a reinterpretation of the past and therefore different from it. There is a change from the use of these designs in their original context, but there is a certain continuity regarding their use as modes of embodied symbolic expressions in varied contexts.

It may be that these abstract designs, rather than the personal statement, attract many people, because the latter can be easily (mis)read. Furthermore, Phillips and Steiner[44](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-44) have argued that a possible way to define it may reside 'in the very process of collection, which inscribes, at the moment of acquisition, the character and qualities that are associated with the object in both individual and collective memories'.[45](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-45) The authenticity of a tattoo similarly may reside in that moment when, inscribed in the body, it acquires the character and qualities of the individual, and collective perceptions of the context from which it arose. In that sense, tattoos can be read adequately only through the context of their creation and the discourse used to convey the personal narrative attached to them, but this context does not rely on some originary, 'tribal' or traditional source. Furthermore, I agree with Sullivan's conclusion[46](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-46) that

bodily inscription is not so much a writing with or on the body (both of which assume a body-subject that pre-exists writing), but rather it is an infinite (re)writing and (re)reading of the body-subject in and through its relations with carnal sensuosity of the Other and the world, and with culturally and historically specific social fictions.[47](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-47)

It could therefore be argued that tattoos are in fact constant changing processes that can be 'read' synchronically.

The absence of reciprocity relations, inherent in the discrete nature of commodity exchange, does not mean that such exchanges will be non-personal encounters. For example, as Thomas explains,[48](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-48) in New Georgia ritual knowledge, and to an extent ritual agency, can be 'purchased' from specialists. The names of these specialists are important to the purchasers and it could be assumed that there was an ongoing particular relationship between the two. However, although 'the practice of ritual may often have involved reference to the source of knowledge, to the empowering authority, . . . in such contexts the allusion to the name figures as authentication and validation, rather than as the expression of longer-term indebtedness'.[49](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-49) This is similar to the way that some tattoos gain authenticity. The name of the tattoo artist is important but does not imply that there is any relationship beyond the particular time spent acquiring the tattoo. The nature of the exchange can vary, however, according to context. There are a number of differences in the nature of the exchange depending on the identities of prospective tattooed individuals and their relationship with the tattoo artist. The price of a tattoo is usually a negotiation, and may or may not involve money. Furthermore, tattoo artists' rates do not seem to be influenced greatly by market forces. Thus it could also be possible that tattooing exchanges are sometimes more akin to Firth's 'exchange by private treaty', a situation in which something like price is arrived at by some negotiated process other than the impersonal forces of supply and demand.[50](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-50) Therefore, it seems that the nature of the exchange of tattoos can vary, depending on context and individual perceptions, from commodity exchange to gift exchange via exchange by private treaty.

Individual perceptions of the nature of the exchange have a great influence, I believe, on determining the status of a tattoo in the commodity spheres. When the prospective tattooed individual chooses a template design and does not engage in any further exchange relations with the tattoo artist, except by name for authentication purposes, the tattoo can be perceived as commoditized. According to this view, a tattoo is a commodity at the time of its exchange and becomes a singularized symbol once decommoditized. The fact that it cannot be exchanged could also classify it as a terminal commodity; that is, not intended for further exchange.[51](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-51) However, one of the interesting aspects of the exchange of tattooing is that, most of the time, it is not directly the tattoo that is valued, but rather the time of the tattoo artist. It could be argued that what is bought is the skill and expertise of the artist and that therefore it is these that are commoditized rather than the tattoo itself. Furthermore, in a sense, the tattoo as an object does not exist until after the exchange: until it is finished. Up to that point it is only the Platonic form of a tattoo. Once finished, it will become a singular entity and therefore will move out of the commodity phase of its biography. In other words, the tattoo is only a commodity during its own process of becoming a singular entity – prior to its birth. Nonetheless, many people will use the financial cost of a tattoo as one of its defining markers. There seems to be no doubt that exclusivity is symbolized through financial restriction. This view, in a sense, assigns to the singular tattoo an identity marker normally associated with commodities, price being a primary symbol of a discrete transaction. Thus, my point is that a tattoo is never really commoditized. On the one hand, it is the skill and time of the tattoo artists that are commoditized, not the tattoo itself. And on the other hand, it is sometimes given the identity of a commodity, as a symbol of exclusivity on financial grounds, when it has already become a singular entity.

Complex societies are prone to yearn for singularization.[52](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-52) It is interesting to note that the rise in popularity of tattoos, and of body modifications in general, coincides with different expansions of the spheres of values and increased momentum towards wider commoditization/commodification. It seems difficult to decide if this is mainly due to a shift in the practice of tattooing towards a different sphere of value or if it emanates from an attraction towards a symbol of embodied singularization. The Western perspective that polarizes people and things, the singular and the commodity, considers the human body to be the most singularized entity. Tattoos will therefore assume a particular place in that polarity. Furthermore, 'power often asserts itself symbolically precisely by insisting on its right to singularize an object, or a set or class of objects'.[53](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-53) Therefore, individuals can symbolically assert their power by their attempts to singularize objects. Thus, tattoos could be perceived as a relevant medium for such symbolic expressions. Nonetheless, there seems to be a paradox in the sense that, however singularized the personal information contained in a tattoo may be, the mainstream use of this particular media will tend to pull it away from its regime of consumption, and lessen its potency as a symbol of embodied singularization.

My analysis therefore leads me towards a view that tattoos themselves are not commodities. However, a phase of their biographies is commoditized; that is, in the process of becoming. What seems therefore to be engaged in the battle between commoditization and singularization is the nature of the exchange; in a sense tattooing rather than tattoos. Depending on the context and on the protagonists involved, and their respective perceptions of the nature of the exchange, tattooing could be classified either as commodity exchange, gift exchange or exchange by private treaty. This flexibility seems to enable the tattoo communities to deal with the popularity of the practice, and offers an array of possible relationships to choose from during complex encounters with a wide range of individuals. This is why, I feel, it is futile to describe 'traditional' tattoos as expressions of 'thick/hot' social relationships, and contemporary tattoos as only able to create, and stem from, 'thin/cold' ones.[54](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-54)

Furthermore, tattoos, and body modifications in general, demand a positive engagement with pain and suffering. This, I believe, indicates that a particular type of relationship may be forged through such experiences. This is because the 'particularly un-negotiable sensation which is pain when involved in ritual, 'acts to embed . . . a connection within a larger network of interpersonal ties . . . a network of relationships'.[55](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-55) These webs of relationships involve multi-dimensional connections among people, places and the social, cultural and historical narratives attached to them, and evolve within the symbolic, aesthetic and political spheres at play in the human condition.

In the Euro-American world, body modification is considered a matter of choice, but body modifications are only optional, in fact, as long as one does not want to belong to a body modification network. Within those networks, they arguably remain a form of initiation ritual.[56](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-56) In this context, however, the transformation of the person has to do less with coming of age and more with an acceptance of personal alterities and a symbol of a 'capacity for intense experience'.[57](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-57) In this, pain is instrumental because its 'social signification . . . is to give a sharper dimension to memory by welding the community through the same references'.[58](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-58) If, further, as Jackson has argued,[59](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-59) the world of constant pain cannot be understood by non-sufferers, because pain 'shatters language',[60](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-60) it could be that these group references exist at the pre-objective level of experience, before it is expressed through language. It can be argued that pain, because it is experienced through the body, can be conceived as an emotion and as such 'contains much that is indeterminate and inchoate, [and so] it is often poorly served by everyday-world language'.[61](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-61) This experience, which can be said to be shared beyond any narratives, could act as a perceived inter-subjectivity across culture and time. This could also account for the 'primal urge' to modify their bodies often cited by body modifiers.

The last point I would like to make is that there is an important aspect of the relationship between pain and tattoos that is clear in the popular adage: 'pain is unavoidable, suffering is optional'. This is a demand not only for the tattooee to engage positively with the painful experience, but also, I believe, a more general demand of a shift of values away from those preached by a form of Protestant humanism that denies the individual its capacity to suffer. Therefore, 'body modification initiates its adepts into a cruel ritual system incommensurable with mainstream religious practice'.[62](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-62) It is, however, crucial to understand that the point is not solely in the pain but also, and in some ways more importantly, in its relief. 'There is a power, innate to all pain, after the relief, an initiatic dimension, a solicitation to live more intensely the consciousness of existence . . . [pain] gives a sense of life's price . . . [and] is a radical principle of metamorphosis'.[63](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-63) This seems to be a recurrent theme raised by my informants. As Stephen, one of them, puts it: 'I feel a lot more alive after each tattoo session. It is almost like a doctor, but not to make you better but to make you feel alive. This is why I get tattooed more and more. It is the sensation of pinching yourself to know if you are awake.' Finally, I would like to suggest that, although some body modifiers' discourse expresses a kind of 'corporeal absolutism',[64](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-64) their tentative assertions of symbolic power over their suffering bodies may have the effect that 'by controlling this violence, by sculpting it with devotion at the heart of the self, [human beings] subordinate their condition rather than submit to it'.[65](19_Reference.xhtml#ref10-65)

This article has shown that the ironic term 'modern primitive' cannot be used as a blanket identity marker to describe these global cross-cultural networks. Through the discussion on issues of commodification, I attempted to show the complexity and heterogeneous nature of the global tattooing community. The level to which such networks are involved in consumer culture and society as a whole tend to imply that, at least for some body modifiers, the agenda is inclusion of their alterity rather than simplistic rebellion.

# EPILOGUE

## Embodied Exchanges and their Limits

Nicholas Thomas

In a recent documentary on tattoo, one of the interviewees is a German woman. She enthuses about the topic. She leans close to the camera and says: 'Once you have one tattoo, you will want more.' This is a deceptively simple statement, but one that arguably speaks volumes about contemporary Euro-American tattooing. It tells us, specifically, what motivates and requires tattooing, and what ontological register tattoos occupy. People get tattoos, in this conception, because they have an individual desire or appetite for them. They are things that you 'want'. They are also things that can exist in a series. One gets one, then another, and then another.

It is obvious that a tattoo such as the _pe'a_ is not generally obtained because it is merely wanted. It, like many other Polynesian body modifications, is obtained because it or they are cosmologically or socially required (if nevertheless also desired), in one specific sense or another. And it will also be apparent that although the _pe'a_ is made up of distinct components, it consists neither of a series of those components nor as an element in a series itself. It is a unity and a totality, not a form susceptible to numeration. The same may be said of the _malu_, even though the woman's form may appear, superficially, to be composed out of a set of discrete elements.

Hence, if a Euro-American subject obtains a _pe'a_ or _malu_ among other tattoos, he or she arguably draws that form away from its cultural predicates. This drawing away, abstraction from, or appropriation, is in any case present in the fact that the Euro-American subject approaches either the male or female Samoan tattoo, not as something socially required, but as one among a range of 'tattoos', one among a possible repertoire of 'neo-tribal' and other tattoos that may be available for a desiring subject's acquisition. Just _how_ available a Samoan tattoo may be to a non-Samoan man or woman is another matter. To acknowledge that _pe'a_ and _malu_ are not simply there for the taking from tattoo studios – but have been taken on, rather, by non-Samoans who, like Fomison, occupy certain relationships with Samoans, already complicates a line of argument that might be developed, on the basis of the juxtaposition I have made, between the cultural underpinnings of Samoan and Euro-American tattoos.

That juxtaposition is consistent with a classical, culturally relativist anthropology that would locate _tatau_ and tattoo within different cultural orders. It is moreover consistent with some (but not all) indigenous Polynesian understandings, which situate Samoan _tatau_ or Maori _ta moko_ in domains that are integrated and distinct. The model that underlies these understandings of difference is, of course, that of language: it is self-evident that Samoan and Maori are different from each other and different from English, and we can see the negotiation between them as a matter of inherently imperfect translation. This way of understanding cultural variety is both implicitly persuasive and manifestly problematic. Language itself is the most compelling of metaphors, and at one level nothing seems more natural than modelling cultural upon linguistic difference. This is not the place to rehearse either the valid aspects or the many real pitfalls of these assumptions in general. The point can merely be made that the case of tattooing – or rather that of _tatau_/tattoo – sits uneasily within these terms. A Euro-American person does not bear a 'translation' of the _pe'a_ but the _pe'a_ itself, yet a _pe'a_ that has been at least partially, and perhaps very profoundly recontextualized.

The examples reviewed in this book suggest that it is vital to position cultural forms in terms different to those presumed by the longstanding debates around cultural relativism. Relativism was always explicitly or implicitly opposed to universalism, whereby sexual mores, psychological attitudes or art symbols were always from one perspective locally distinctive valuations, or from the other the effects of structural, cognitive or biological constants. The materials considered here are cross-cultural from the start, which is to say neither culturally unique nor universal. Each Polynesian _tatau_ tradition represented a particular transformation of others. Each modern _tatau_ and tattoo practice drew upon, differentiated itself from, and sustained or forgot antecedent practices. These transformations were possible and are possible because tattoo practices and tattoos have possessed cross-cultural efficacy and salience as well as culturally specific meaning. That cross-cultural efficacy has entailed the potential for their interested recognition and misrecognition, the possibility that they may be adopted or appropriated rather than ignored.

The cases considered in this book, moreover, also displace the comparative operation from theory to history. Those interested in cross-cultural analysis have, as it were, been beaten to the game by Rutherford and Sulu'ape as well as many before, between and since. Those actors, who applied or assumed cross-cultural tattoos, engaged in translation, or rather transposition and recontextualization. They pre-empted the question of whether and how _tatau_ could be taken from one cultural milieu into another – by simply doing it.

If we recognize that _tatau_ was even, in its varied pre-colonial Polynesian expressions, always already a cross-cultural, historically shaped adaptation, that does not alter the point that, within specific societies, it assumed particular values and meanings – meanings that may indeed be as coherent and distinctive as the Tahitian, Samoan and Maori languages. To acknowledge this would seem only to take us back to the point that I have made and retreated from – that the Samoan tattoo specifically has a singular motivation and logic, even an ontology, which the tattoo form itself can be abstracted from, but which is not susceptible to translation.

It remains important to affirm this point – that different modes of tattooing may be fundamentally distinct in their predicates, in the notions of the person, the body, and society, that underlie them. But, just as languages may diverge, merge or otherwise change, the absoluteness of this distinct integrity may become historically compromised. It is evident that since at least the mid-twentieth century, when Groves produced his drawings, that the classic Samoan _pe'a_ could coexist with other tattoo (not _tatau_) forms. And that has clearly become far more common more recently. This does not mean that the _pe'a_ or _malu_ no longer has its own highly distinctive qualities, but that those qualities cannot be associated with one culture that is located in Samoa, and juxtaposed with another that is located in Europe or America. It is evident rather that both logics may appear, in compromised forms, on the one body. This instance might appear only as one of what anthropologists used to call 'acculturation', otherwise labelled syncretism, creolization or hybridity.

But at this point it needs to be recalled that Samoan _tatau_ is only one among many Polynesian practices. In Tahiti, _tatau_ incorporated both a unitary whole – the standard blacked buttocks and arches – _and_ potentially a series of idiosyncratic elements. In other words, the art form already incorporated distinctive predicates. It is vital that we do not underestimate the complexity and heterogeneity of Pacific art – which cannot be recognized purely as a collectively motivated practice, which may be culturally or ontologically juxtaposed to Western values. If we accept that the form the Western tattoo took – that is, that of the individually desired, individual motif – already existed within the Polynesian tattoo world it is not only our understanding of indigenous tattoo traditions that must change. 'Translation' seems, less than ever, the right term. Nor is it any longer obvious that the Europeans who take on 'neo-tribal' tattoos necessarily perpetrate an invidious distortion of indigenous values. In some cases they certainly do, but in others they may not. The issue can be adjudicated only by talking about which people, when, in the contexts of what cross-cultural dealings. Kabris's case is not the same as Rutherford's, and Rutherford's is not the same as Fomison's. To look at tattooing now – to look at _tatau_/tattoo now – is like looking through a kaleidoscopic device. When you turn the tube, every element of the world changes, to fall into place – or not – in a new way.

This practice is universal among them, and is called tat-tow, a term which they afterwards applied to letters when they saw us write, being themselves perfectly illiterate' (p. 44).

[16](05_Introduction.xhtml#int1-16) James Cook, 'Description of King Georges Island', discursive entry following 13 July 1769, printed in _The Journals of Captain James Cook_ , ed. J. C. Beaglehole (Cambridge, 1955–67), vol. I, p. 125. C. P. Jones, in 'Stigma and Tattoo', in _Written on the Body_ , p. 1, says that Cook's description was 'not published until 1893'. This is only correct in the sense that Cook's journal was not transcribed and published until that date; the passage in John Hawkesworth's _Account of the Voyages_ (London, 1773) incorporates a polished version of Cook's account.

[20](05_Introduction.xhtml#int1-20) In addition to Douglas's discussion, see, for early Tahiti, sources such as Teuira Henry, _Ancient Tahiti_ (Honolulu, 1928), Douglas L. Oliver, _Ancient Tahitian Society_ (Honolulu 1974), Thomas, _Discoveries_ , and Anne Salmond, _The Trial of the Cannibal Dog_ (London, 2003). The most extensive recent synthesis and analysis of information concerning Tahitian tattooing is in Gell, _Wrapping in Images_. The Tahitian term for 'native' employed by Gell is consistently misprinted and should be _maohi_ not _moahi_.
