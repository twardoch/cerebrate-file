@testdata/poml-fix-pdf-extracted-text.xml contains a prompt. 

Letâ€™s modify our @src/cerebrate_file and @pyproject.toml so that: 

1. Inside @src/cerebrate_file we have a folder `prompts`, and the package installer includes that folder and all its contents in the installation of the Python package. 

2. We put @testdata/poml-fix-pdf-extracted-text.xml into @src/cerebrate_file/prompts as `fix-pdf-extracted-text.xml`

3. The package has a concept of the `prompt_library_path`, which is the `prompts` folder inside the installed location of our package. 

3. If `--file_prompt` is given (followed by a path), we first check if the given path exists as is, and if not, we add the file_prompt to prompt_library_path and check if that file exists, and if so, we load the prompt from there. 

Note: The prompt files inside the prompt_library_path may have any extensions and formats (XML, TXT, MD, JSON etc.). We are not validating any content there.
