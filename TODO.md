# Cerebrate File TODO - Issues #102 Implementation

## âœ… Phase 1: Add Rich Dependency and Basic UI Components - COMPLETED âœ…
- [x] Add `rich>=13.0.0` to dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- [x] Remove `tqdm>=4.66.0` from dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- [x] Create `src/cerebrate_file/ui.py` module for UI components
- [x] Create `FileProgressDisplay` class to manage two-row output
- [x] Create progress bar helper functions
- [x] Design minimalistic two-row display system with no borders
- [x] Create tests for UI components in `tests/test_ui.py`

## âœ… Phase 2: Replace Current Progress System with Rich UI - COMPLETED âœ…
- [x] Replace `tqdm` import and usage in `cerebrate_file.py:15`
- [x] Update `process_document()` function to use rich progress callbacks
- [x] Modify `cli.py` to use new progress display
- [x] Update `make_cerebras_request()` to trigger progress callbacks
- [x] Maintain verbose/quiet mode compatibility
- [x] Test progress display with single file processing
- [x] Ensure two-row display shows: input path + progress, output path + remaining calls

## âœ… Phase 3: Extend CLI Interface for Recursive Processing - COMPLETED âœ…
- [x] Add `--recurse` parameter to CLI `run()` function signature
- [x] Add `--workers` parameter to CLI `run()` function signature (default: 4)
- [x] Update `validate_inputs()` in `config.py` to handle directory inputs
- [x] Add validation for `recurse` parameter in `config.py`
- [x] Implement directory vs file detection logic
- [x] Update help text and CLI documentation
- [x] Test CLI accepts new parameters without breaking existing usage

## âœ… Phase 4: Implement Recursive File Discovery - COMPLETED âœ…
- [x] Create `src/cerebrate_file/recursive.py` module
- [x] Implement `find_files_recursive()` function using `pathlib.Path.rglob(pattern)`
- [x] Create `replicate_directory_structure()` function
- [x] Add directory structure replication logic
- [x] Create file list generation and validation
- [x] Handle edge cases: no matches, permission errors, invalid patterns
- [x] Test recursive file discovery with various glob patterns
- [x] Test output directory structure correctly replicates input structure

## âœ… Phase 5: Implement Parallel Processing Pipeline - COMPLETED âœ…
- [x] Create parallel processing coordinator using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
- [x] Implement `process_files_parallel()` function
- [x] Integrate with existing `process_document()` function
- [x] Implement worker pool management with configurable worker count
- [x] Add progress aggregation across multiple files
- [x] Handle worker exceptions and failures gracefully
- [x] Update progress display to show multiple files
- [x] Test parallel processing with different worker counts

## âœ… Phase 6: Integration and UI Enhancement - COMPLETED âœ…
- [x] Integrate recursive processing with rich UI
- [x] Update `FileProgressDisplay` to handle multiple files (MultiFileProgressDisplay)
- [x] Enhance progress display for multiple files
- [x] Add overall progress tracking: `Processing file X of Y`
- [x] Implement remaining API calls calculation across files
- [x] Aggregate remaining API calls across all files
- [x] Maintain individual file progress in two-row format
- [x] Test rich UI works seamlessly with parallel processing

## âœ… Phase 7: Testing and Documentation - COMPLETED âœ…
- [x] Create `tests/test_recursive.py` for recursive processing tests
- [x] Create comprehensive tests for new functionality (25 integration tests)
- [x] Update existing tests to work with rich UI
- [x] Test with various glob patterns and directory structures
- [x] Test parallel processing with different worker counts
- [x] Update integration tests to cover new workflows
- [x] Test edge cases and error conditions:
  - [x] Empty directories
  - [x] Invalid glob patterns
  - [x] Permission denied scenarios
  - [x] Network failures during parallel processing
  - [x] Very large directory structures
  - [x] Files with special characters in names
- [x] Update documentation and help text
- [x] Verify all existing CLI options work unchanged

## âœ… Validation Checklist - COMPLETED âœ…
- [x] Rich UI displays correctly in various terminals
- [x] Parallel processing completes successfully
- [x] Directory structure replication is accurate
- [x] Error handling prevents cascading failures
- [x] Performance scales appropriately with worker count
- [x] Existing single-file processing unchanged
- [x] All CLI options work as documented
- [x] Memory usage remains reasonable for large directories
- [x] All tests pass including new functionality (58 tests passing)
- [x] Edge cases properly handled and tested
- [x] Documentation accurately reflects new features

## âœ… Quality Assurance - COMPLETED âœ…
- [x] All new modules under 200 lines (recursive.py: 119 lines)
- [x] Comprehensive type hints for all functions
- [x] Detailed docstrings following existing patterns
- [x] Error handling with proper logging
- [x] Unit tests for all public functions
- [x] No regression in existing functionality
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Dependencies justified and minimal
