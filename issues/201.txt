Our `cerebrate-file` package is great. We don’t need to do any major changes or "improvements" (especially for improvements sake). 

One thing that we need to improve though: 

With `--recurse`, the tool searches for candidate input files. Then it shows the total of the candidates, and starts progressing. 

When the progress arrives at a certain input file, we check if that certain input file’s corresponding output file exists, and if `--force` is not given, we skip processing the input file, and inform the user. In other words, the "screening" (check whether we need to actually process the file) happens during the progress. 

We need to change that: we need to separate the whole process into two stages: 

1. pre-screening: if --force is given, we skip that stage; otherwise we check the entire batch of identified input files, and if the corresponding output file exists, we remove the input file from the batch. 
2. progress: we report the total and now proceed to the actual processing. 

Make a detailed /plan on how to implement this, and then /work on it.
