# Changelog

All notable changes to cerebrate-file will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-20

### Added
- **Prompt Library Feature**: Built-in prompt library for common use cases (#202)
  - Added `prompts/` folder inside the package with pre-configured prompts
  - First prompt: `fix-pdf-extracted-text.xml` for cleaning up poorly extracted PDF text
  - Smart prompt resolution: checks direct paths first, then falls back to library
  - Simple usage: `--file-prompt fix-pdf-extracted-text.xml` loads from library
  - Extensible: prompts can have any extension (XML, TXT, MD, JSON, etc.)
  - Helpful error messages list available prompts when file not found
  - Full test coverage with 10 passing tests

- **Pre-Screening for Recursive Processing**: Improved efficiency and user experience (#201)
  - Pre-screens files before starting progress reporting to show accurate counts
  - Filters out files with existing outputs when `--force=False` before processing begins
  - Clear messaging: "Found X candidates, Y will be processed (Z skipped - use --force to include)"
  - Accurate progress bars that only show files that will actually be processed
  - Minimal performance overhead with early file existence checks
  - Comprehensive test coverage with unit and integration tests
  - Consistent behavior between single-file and recursive modes

- **Force Option**: New `--force` boolean CLI flag for overwrite control
  - Prevents accidental overwriting of existing output files by default
  - Check occurs before any LLM API calls to save quota and processing time
  - Works in both single-file and recursive processing modes
  - Clear user messaging when files are skipped: "⚠️ Output file already exists. Use --force to overwrite."
  - Smart logic: only applies when input and output paths differ (in-place editing unaffected)
  - Comprehensive test suite with 8 test cases covering all scenarios
  - Backward compatible: default is False, existing usage unchanged

- **Comprehensive GitHub Pages Documentation**: Full Jekyll-based documentation site
  - Complete documentation site using Just-the-Docs theme
  - 10+ detailed documentation pages covering all aspects
  - Installation, usage, configuration, and troubleshooting guides
  - API reference for programmatic usage
  - Real-world examples and use cases
  - Development and contribution guidelines
  - Quick start guide for new users
  - Searchable documentation with navigation

### Fixed
- **Rate Limit Display**: Removed incorrect token calculation from remaining quota display
  - Fixed misleading "remaining tokens" calculation that multiplied requests by average chunk size
  - Now correctly shows only actual remaining daily requests from Cerebras API headers
  - Display simplified to show `📊 Remaining today: X requests` without bogus token count
