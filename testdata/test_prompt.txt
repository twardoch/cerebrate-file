We extracted our text from a PDF, and performed some post-processing (so there may already be some Markdown formatting). Overall, our text is quite badly structured and formatted. Convert it to clean Markdown: merge lines where appropriate, fix OCR mistakes, remove garbled strings, remove hard-hyphenation artifacts. Conservatively add Markdown headings and other Markdown formatting, but only where youâ€™re absolutely certain. Do not rephrase, condense, omit actual text. Do not add or change words (except mere spelling corrections). Do not add/invent stuff.
