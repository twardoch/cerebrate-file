# Task A

Add very minimal 'rich' support.

Replace the progress bar with a setup where processing of each file gets visualized by just two-row microtable: 

- In the 1st row on the left side we see the input path and on the right side we get the chunk progress bar (using rich progress bar). 
- In the 2nd line gets emitted at the end: on the left is the save path, and on the right the remaining API calls (drop the remaining tokens calculation). 

Make sure the text UI is extremely minimalistic, no borders etc. But color is OK.
